My guess is that there are rulings in place that preclude certain witnesses from being called, certain evidence from being shown, and certain topics from being broached - but how, and why? And are those constraints known to the jury? For instance, there was a last minute witness that somehow offered herself up to testify, a very crucial character witness, that i would have thought the plaintiff would spare no expense in finding. There was a photo expert that was somehow prevented from talking about colors, there is a lot of confusion about the existence or non-existence of a wall mounted phone, but both parties have refrained from showing images of the wall that the phone should have hung on - although the existence of such photos is a near certainty, etc. So my questions: How are such no-show-no-tell boundaries established, does the jury get to know them, and is this also in the public record somehow? \nTITLE: ", "output": "What are the constraints on a civil suit (witnesses, evidence, topics) - and are they public"}

To make this widely applicable and more readily answerable: Suppose I want to file a 42 USC 1983 complaint in U.S. federal court for some violation of my fourth-amendment rights by a municipal police officer. I believe the first thing I would want to do is find and read similar cases that have been adjudicated on that law using similar claims in my district. In fact, if I'm reasonably literate I assume I could construct all necessary filings and arguments using examples from prior cases, in addition to getting a sense of my odds of success in court.

This year I am traveling rather large distances for work. My colleague asked me how I can bear the costs of travel. I told her it is ok, because the government allows me to deduct a large part of my travel costs from my taxes. My colleague warned me that she has heard that the government will revoke these rules, making it no longer possible to deduct as much of my travel costs from my taxes. Her argument was that since my taxes for 2019 will be done in april of 2020, the government could, at any point before that date, change the rules so that I may no longer be able to deduct my travel expenses. I argued that rules could only apply to travels/work that occurred after said rules were implemented, and could not apply retroactively.

Every facility I've seen is blanketed with cameras, potentially including microphones, the internet connection is provided and monitored by them, and their staff greets every visitor for a meeting. I've reviewed the contracts from a few of these companies and was surprised to discover they do not explicitly state they will limit their use of information they learn about their customers' businesses merely to the realm of providing the service to the customers. One would expect at least a simple and clear statement that customer trade secrets and intellectual property will not be used by nor shared by the coworking company. But no such statement is provided. Is there something I am not understanding here? For example, is there overarching legal precedent (which wouldn't be included in the contract) that protects a small business if they use one of these facilities?

His defence was that he was killing Talat Pasha in retaliation for his crimes in orchestrating the Ottoman Armenian Genocide. Tehlirian was tried for murder, but was eventually acquitted by the twelve-man jury. His trial was a rather sensationalized event at the time, taking place shortly after the establishment of the Weimar Republic, with Tehlirian being represented by three German defense attorneys, including Dr. Theodor Niemeyer, professor of law at Kiel University. Priest and Armenian Genocide survivor Grigoris Balakian, German activist Johannes Lepsius, and German commander of the Ottoman armed forces during the war General Liman von Sanders were among several of the prominent individuals called as witnesses to the trial. The trial examined not only Tehlirian\u2019s actions but also Tehlirian's conviction that Tal\u00e2t was the main author of the Armenian deportation and mass killings. The defense attorneys made no attempt to deny the fact that Tehlirian had killed a man, and instead focused on the influence of the Armenian Genocide on Tehlirian's mental state. Tehlirian claimed during the trial that he had been present in Erzincan in 1915 and had been deported along with his family and personally witnessed their murder. When asked by the judge if he felt any sort of guilt, Tehlirian remarked, \"I do not consider myself guilty because my conscience is clear\u2026I have killed a man. But I am not a murderer. However, murder in retaliation for crimes the victim committed is often not considered a legal defence to the act of murder. For example, this 2013 Baltimore case resulted in the sentencing of the killer to 30 years in jail. Similarly, the Lillehammer affair involves Israeli Mossad agents sent to assassinate a (mistakenly identified) mastermind of the Munich attacks on Israelis. The agents were arrested and convicted by Norwegian authorities. A final example was the case of Vitaly Kaloyev, who stabbed to death the air traffic controller responsible for the \u00dcberlingen mid-air collision in which his family was killed. He was also convicted for murder in that case and sentenced to prison.

I'm studying a chapter on a book about Bonds where I see: A bond is a special form of contract, whereby one party, the surety, guarantees the performance by another party, the principal, of certain obligations. The party to whom the obligations are owed is called the obligee. Reading this link I find: Insurance: When a claim is paid the insurance company usually doesn\u2019t expect to be repaid by the insured. Surety Bond: A surety bond is a form of credit, so the principal is responsible to pay any claims. Typically, the surety requires the principal and its major shareholders to indemnify the surety against any loss. In fact, the indemnity given by the principal is one of the things that distinguishes a bond from an insurance contract My doubt is: If as a contractor(principal) you will be required to repay to the surety for any losses that the surety had to pay to the owner(obligee). What are the advantages of a bond over liability insurance where the insurance company pays and the contractor doesn't have to repay anything else that the usual monthly premiums? Why creating the figure of the surety if the contractor will end up having to pay the surety to compensate for what the surety paid to the obligee anyway? Why not using liability insurance for this? I don't understand very well the notion of face value of a bond which is \"the maximum potential liability of the surety\".

But I am confused with certain measures taken thus far by the government. There is currently a temporary shutdown of vast sectors of the economy now and workers affected are not receiving any income. To me, logic would dictate that here should also be a temporary cessation of payments for rental properties (for small businesses as well as individuals) and, to be fair, a temporary cessation of payments for loans for owners of those properties. In turn, banks would be given temporary cessation payments for interest to its customers since the banks would not receive any payments on loans including payments on mortgages from homeowners. That would essentially close the loop on money flow which again would be temporary and the impact to the greater economy would be limited. If undue burden is placed on any one of these points in the cycle, and right now, workers and small businesses are taking that brunt, then there could be long-standing damage to the economy from bankruptcies, foreclosures, etc. The Fed is already addressing the banking side of things by keeping rates close to 0. Does the government have the authority to push for a standstill in mortgage/interest/rent payments?

There is one way to include a website inside another: <iframe> (w3schools description) However, some websites decide that they don't want to get iframed. For example Google doesn't allow other websites to frame their content. This has of course certain reasons. There is a very simple option, the X-Frame-Option that can tell a browser that it must not render a page withing a frame if it is not from the same origin as the page itself. So far so good. Just for the sake of completeness I want to say that it's still possible to display just the content of another website. The most trivial one would be to hit CTRL + S on my keyboard, save the website and host it on another server. A more sophisticated of course would be to write a program that does that for me. One could simply download the HTML page and embed the result into another. I can imagine that e.g. copyright could be an issue. But what if my site states that it does not own the content etc. and that it did not modify anything and so on. Is there a way that this could be legal? Example What is with this example? https://proxy-nl.hide.me allows you to enter any URL and e.g. specify that it should remove JavaScript code.

The title should be legally relevant, capture key aspects of the issue, and entice readers to learn more. \nQUESTION: This question comes out of reading this New York Times article (quoted below), about a bill that would allow officers to use a \"textalyzer\" to digitally search phones for evidence that the phones had been handled recently: The technology could determine whether a driver had used the phone to text, email or do anything else that is forbidden under New York\u2019s hands-free driving laws, which prohibit drivers from holding phones to their ear. Failure to hand over a phone could lead to the suspension of a driver\u2019s license, similar to the consequences for refusing a Breathalyzer. The intention is behavior change: \u201cWe need something on the books where people\u2019s behavior can change,\u201d said [F\u00e9lix W. Ortiz, a Democratic assemblyman who was a sponsor of the bipartisan Textalyzer bill], who pushed for the state\u2019s 2001 ban on hand-held devices by drivers. If the Textalyzer bill becomes law, he said, \u201cpeople are going to be more afraid to put their hands on the cellphone.\u201d The US Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that when somebody is arrested, their phone can't be searched without a warrant. But the bill\u2019s authors say they have based the Textalyzer concept on the same \u201cimplied consent\u201d legal theory that allows the police to use the Breathalyzer: When drivers obtain a license, they are consenting in advance to a Breathalyzer, or else they will risk the suspension of their license. (Emphasis added.) The analogy to the Breathalyzer is based on comparability of dangers, too: Deborah Hersman, the president of the nonprofit National Safety Council and a former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, ... said the Textalyzer-Breathalyzer comparison was apt because looking at and using a phone can be as dangerous as driving drunk. \u201cWhy are we making a distinction between a substance you consume and one that consumes you?\u201d How far does this \"implied consent\" legal theory go? Can it be extended to mean that drivers' license applicants give \"implied consent\" to have their cars, homes, or body cavities searched in detail, or give \"implied consent\" to physical control by police (to enforce any failures to comply with an instruction), etc., if police request that power and find a suitably sympathetic audience in the General Assembly? It's an old argument that increasing police search powers increases safety, because it allows the police to search out and stamp out whatever behavior creates the danger to others. Where's the line, if any, which limits the extent of how far that can go? What do people really consent to when applying for a driver's license? Can \"implied consent\" be retroactive, such that if I have a New York driver's license today, that means I've given \"implied consent\" to whatever permissions the General Assembly grants police a couple years after I've gotten that license? If not, does a license renewal establish that \"consent?\" There is some precedent in that having gotten a NY license a few years ago does indicate consent to be bound by traffic laws including updates and changes that occur during the period of license validity. Is \"implied consent\" to searches one of the topics covered by that? This is tagged for New York, but as the article notes: If it were to pass in New York,... it could well spread in the same way that the hands-free rules did after New York adopted them. So feel free to answer for other jurisdictions, if they are a better fit for your expertise, and note that in your answer. \nTITLE: ", "output": "What are the limits of \"implied consent\" when obtaining a driver's license?"}

They were not only ineffective, but I experienced withdrawal symptoms taking those. What legal recourse do I have? Obviously, the attorney's fee will cost more than the Rx. Here are the details... Cutting the tablets in half, it was obvious that the previous tablets --that were effective-- looked different from the last Rx that was not. The tablets that were effective had a layer of dark gray on one side; the \"dud\" batch did not, but instead had an all-white interior. As soon as I took the replacement non-time-release alternative Rx prescribed by my physician, I experienced relief from the withdrawal symptoms as well as my medical condition. The M.D. told me that I needed to contact the pharmacy. Well, both the manager of the Sam's Club pharmacy in Springfield, MO and the lady I spoke with at the drug manufacturer have flatly stated (over the phone) that they will neither accept a return (or even samples for testing) nor refund the price we paid for these dud, ineffective tablets. The lady at the manufacturer told me that they would file a manufacturing defect report to the FDA. That was all. The pharmacy manager claimed that the tablets for the previous, effective Rx was from the same batch as the last, \"dud\" Rx refill. What to do? I've already contacted a local TV news station that has excellent consumer-advocacy spots (On Your Side Contact KY3).

I was given a fine (which was more than fair given my mistake), paid it without contesting, and then renewed my plates (with a late fee). The payments for my plate sticker went through and I was able to confirm that my plates were listed in the Secretary of State database as \"In Good Standing\". A week later I was still waiting for my sticker to come in the mail but parked my car on a city street. A Chicago officer issued another expired plates violation for my vehicle while I was away and didn't have an opportunity to explain that my plates were now in good standing for atleast the past week and I was merely waiting for the sticker in the mail. I immediately contested this ticket online, providing evidence of my receipt from the Secretary of State's office that I had renewed well before this ticket was issued (and worded it as formally and politely as I could have). I thought when my situation was reviewed it would be rather open and shut, and the fine would be dropped; however today I received a letter in the mail that a local judge had reviewed my case and determined the violation was still in affect. It then stated I would need to pay additional money in order to open a civil lawsuit to sue the city of Chicago if I wanted to appeal further; otherwise, I would need to pay my fine. It is my understanding they are probably within their right to press forward on charging me (I believe state law is that even if your plates are in good standing you can be fined for not displaying your sticker within 30 days of the original expiration date); however, I felt my situation would have been more understandable and that I had done my best to renew my plates prior to when this new violation was issued. In short, I have a 60 dollar fine (not for having expired plates but for not receiving my sticker quickly enough to display). Please let me know if a circuit court in Chicago would be even be willing to see things from my perspective or if I should just hand over more money. Lastly, If I were to file a civil lawsuit how much would I expect to pay to even try appealing this? Would I effectively be losing more money than if I just paid this fine? I tried to get this answered by calling the circuit court's financial department yesterday but they just transferred me to different branches for over an hour. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Do I have grounds to file a civil lawsuit against the City of Chicago for my Expired Plates Violation?

Can we file in the city of Beaumont for small claims court to get his personal property back? What are the procedures to file? What forms do we need to use? My uncle is not fluent in English speaking, can we request a translator? Thank you in advance for all your help. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Is it illegal to withhold someone's passport and green card in California?"}

However I was told few days ago that the property manager has made a mistake and that they shouldn't have renewed it because the owner needs it from August till December. I demanded compensation because all rentals around me cost higher, and because good deals are now off market (university area). However, the Leasing office is not willing to pay anything, and they are arguing that this is because I shouldn't have been offered this lease in the first place, and that the reason why my lease is actually just $X is that it is a short term lease.

Does that mean that an organization can keep all non-sensitive data for a user? For an example, if there is a Database record: Phone| Option| Actived| Deactivated| ...

This process of hiding users data is considered anonymization and as such should not be applicable. On the other hand, this approach will ensure that information about users who had option A activated last year will be kept without storing the users personal information. However, by matching multiple sources, someone COULD potentially still find out what this number was.

Company B did not consent to anything. Company B is having its hardware/software check the USB descriptor of the peripheral in various ways before accepting to use it.

What does the law say about mimicking USB descriptors ? Is there a uniform law over countries on this subject ?

Company B sells consoles, and special USB controllers that use a custom protocol to communicate with their console, which looks for a given VID/PID to try to communicate with the controllers.

Modern technology has allowed for bigger projects even into open sea. For example, Palm Jumeirah sticks 5 km into the sea, and Palm Deira (which is under construction) will stick out 14 km into the Persian Gulf. I don't think these affect Dubai's territorial waters, but one can easily imagine similar projects in other countries which would have an effect on them. Singapore, for example, lies very close to both Indonesian and Malaysian territories and is doing a lot of land reclamation. With technological advances and increasing populations, need for land may become larger, and bigger projects may be undertaken in the future.

What I would really like to understand is whether the right to be forgotten section in GDPR means: \"The person is forgotten about\" or \"all the person's data is erased\". Can anyone please share a reputable source that either explains how can we still comply to GDPR given when the data is erased in the application layer, it is actually not erased in reality and may still be recoverable, or a source that explains that the data is permitted to still be recoverable. I give three examples below for cases where even though the data may be erased in the application layer, it may still be recoverable in reality. Some databases have journaling, redo and undo spaces. Hence, if you delete data from the database, it might still be recoverable. Is this a problem for GDPR compliance? For disaster recovery purposes, data is often backed up, and sometimes on sequential append only media devices such as tape drives. If you need to erase data to comply to GDPR, do you still need to take care to delete the data from the backup? How is this done? In some cases you'd need to re-write the entire storage unit again to a new storage unit to accommodate for this. In SSD when you change data it may be written in a new place, and the new data might still be present on the disk. Is this a problem for GDPR compliance?

We are in a rural area and don't have many options in providers, so I'm pretty much stuck with who I have. I'm set up on auto-draft and have never missed a payment, and we have never had an interruption in service. We are happy with our internet speed, and do not need anything faster. About a year and a half ago, they tried to tell me the plan I'm on is no longer available and they wanted to charge me slightly more and move me to one of their new plans. I declined their \"faster and more reliable internet\" (because it already is fast and reliable) and they told me they would keep my service and my bill the same ($42.74/mo). They said that as long as I don't change my plan, I'm grandfathered-in at the price and service I'm getting, and that there was nothing they could do about it. Yesterday, I received a letter in the mail (from NewWave) stating, \"The internet service I subscribe to is being discontinued, and my service is being moved to a comparable service or plan.\" Same thing they tried to tell me before. That comparable plan takes me from 1000 GB Data Plan ($42.74/mo) to a lower 300GB plan ($55.00/mo) and if I go over the 300GB, they will charge me an EXTRA $10/mo for every 100GB I go over. They note that my actual monthly data usage for the Oct-Dec months has been 701GB. In what world is that a comparable plan? I called the number on the letter, and they said that NewWave Communications is being bought out by Cable ONE, and that this new company is going to charge me TWICE the amount for a \"new\" plan that I've always had because this new company says my plan doesn't exist. Look, my internet is just fine the way it is. Nobody is coming out to my house and re-wiring anything, and I'm not asking for anything more other than to leave me and my bill alone. Shouldn't this \"new\" company honor the price that I've had for years? I mean, AT&T and Verizon don't offer unlimited plans to people anymore, but the people who got on those plans before they changed what they offer weren't forced to get another plan, right? They are grandfathered-in. When Cable ONE acquires NewWave, don't they have to honor the previous agreements of the people that had them before they bought the company? I understand that this new company structures their plans differently. Fine. When they get new customers, that's what they'll have to pay, but I am NOT a new customer. I am the same customer, paying the same price (with apparently slower service than the rest of the world even though we can't tell and don't care to to know the difference), and I'm getting the same service I have always gotten. Just because Company A sold to Company B, what gives them the right to all of a sudden charge me double? I didn't ask for any of this, and as an honorable customer in good standing, I do not appreciate being treated like this.

Vandevelde This \u201cbut for\u201d test has proved inadequate where two defendants jointly cause an injury that would have occurred even if only one of them had acted. For example, if two men negligently discharge firearms, both of which fire fatal shots into the victim, in a lay sense of the term both men \u201ccaused\u201d the injury. Yet by applying the \u201cbut for\u201d test, neither man can be shown to have caused it. If the first man had not fired his weapon, the victim would still have been killed by the second shot. Thus, one cannot say that but for the first man\u2019s negligence, the injury would not have occurred. The same reasoning exonerates the second man as well. [1.] The \u201cbut for\u201d test, in other words, would absolve both gunmen of liability for the shooting. Accordingly, many courts have adopted a rule that provides an alternative definition of actual causation. Under this rule, a defendant\u2019s breach of duty is considered the actual cause of an injury if it was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury, even though the breach may not have been the \u201cbut for\u201d cause. The outcome of applying this test to the shooting circumstances would be that either of the two gunmen would be considered the cause of the death. Why is 1 true? Why cannot both shooters be found liable for the shooting? \nTITLE: ", "output": "How has the \u201cbut for\u201d test proven inadequate where two defendants jointly cause an injury that would have occurred even if only one of them had acted?"}

For example, if somebody has leased property like a vehicle and defaults on their lease the most expeditious way for the true owner to recover the property seems to be repossession, which is essentially physical recovery by \"reasonable\" force. But when it comes to a living space the old saying, \"Possession is nine-tenths of the law,\" seems almost literally applicable: To my knowledge, in the United States at least, there are state and local laws that make it extremely cumbersome for a property owner to evict a tenant in default (and thereby recover the use of their rightful property). Is this accurate? Or are there conditions or methods whereby a property owner can legally use private force (i.e., not the force of agents of the state) and occupation to repossess living spaces being held by \"squatters?\" Amendment: If someone trespasses on my property I can not only arrest them myself, but I can also immediately summon police and ask for their arrest and criminal prosecution.

The use of a permanently attached antenna or of an antenna that uses a unique coupling to the intentional radiator shall be considered sufficient to comply with the provisions of this section. The manufacturer may design the unit so that a broken antenna can be replaced by the user, but the use of a standard antenna jack or electrical connector is prohibited. [...] 47 CFR \u00a7 15.212(a)(2)(iv): Manufacturers must ensure that only transmitter control elements and radio front end components that have been approved together are capable of operating together. The transmitter module must not operate unless it has verified that the installed transmitter control elements and radio front end have been authorized together. Manufacturers may use means including, but not limited to, coding in hardware and electronic signatures in software to meet these requirements, and must describe the methods in their application for equipment authorization. As a result, manufacturers are forced to actively design wireless radio devices to prevent unauthorized end-user modifications: The RP-TNC connector used for Wi-Fi antennas was originally meant to be a nonstandard connector to prevent consumers from replacing antennas with those not approved by the manufacturer. The connector ultimately gained widespread use; however, the FCC has not taken action against device manufacturers. Major laptop manufacturers, including Dell, HP, and Lenovo, restrict the specific Wi-Fi cards which may be installed into a particular system through the use of \"whitelists\" in system firmware that specify which card models are allowed. If a Wi-Fi card that isn't on the whitelist is installed, the system will not boot. Why hold the manufacturer responsible for preventing end-users from making modifications? What is the philosophy or historical basis for these rules?

Just to be clear, that isn't strictly correct, right? A quick wikipedia search shows that in Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe Inc. As a distributor, CompuServe could only be held liable for defamation if it knew, or had reason to know, of the defamatory nature of the content. As CompuServe had made no effort to review the large volume of content on its forums, it could not be held liable for the defamatory content. In one source online, I even saw Section 230 described as Congress enacted \u00a7 230 to remove the disincentives to self-regulation So which is it? Does the removal Section 230 mean a site will be held liable for the content created by others? Or, does it mean that a site will only be held liable if they engage in optional moderation or acts of \"publishing\" (such as filtering and removal of offensive material).

This level of control over the Journalism Forum is insufficient to rise to the level of an agency relationship.

This makes me wonder how 'criminality' is defined if the laws of my home country differ from the country the computer is in. I'm wondering at what point the location of a server/computer decide the laws that apply to it and at what point it's the location of the user that matters. To give some examples, not so much expecting answers to all of the below so much as explaining my confusion of distinction in case it informs an answer. For example, lets say I choose to view material that is not legal for me to view in my home state (copyright material I haven't payed for, some type of outlawed pornography, some sort of state secret I'm not suppose to see etc), but which is legal to view in the country in which some server I connect to is located. I'm pretty sure I've committed a crime, even if the computer providing the data is illegal, but is this only because the data was copied to my computer? If I use some VNC technology that shows me the screen of another computer located outside of the US to view this data without any of it stored or cached on my computer, am I still committing a crime (I think so?) On the other hand I see servers located outside of the US doing things that would be illegal in the US, online gambling, 'spamming' people, selling things without paying US taxes etc. Can I connect to a server for any reason and still be legal? If amazon want's to have a server in some country X and pay that countries taxes instead of US taxes can someone from the US still connect to that server to do anything at all with it without suddenly being guilty of violating a law because that server isn't abiding by US law? If it's the location of the user that matters then does that mean I can use a computer outside the US to do something that is illegal in that country? If I'm in the US and using a cloud computer hosted in say the UK and for some reason I end up doing something with that computer that is 100% legal in the US but isn't legal in UK (maybe some data is allowed to view here that isn't there?) have I broken the law in UK? If I happen to travel to UK at some later date could a zealous prosecute arrest me because of the location of my computer?

From what I understand, this exemption falls into one of two broad categories: Teaching, research, news reporting, etc. Basically, this is \"educational\" use of one sort or another. Although there may be a commercial purpose (for a college, research lab, newspaper), etc., there is a public policy priority of informing people. The second category is comment, criticism, or parody. Here, the use is clearly commercial, but is often allowed. My understanding is that's because such work is protected under free speech, and perhaps opens new markets (e.g. among people who are \"anti\" a given work, and who probably wouldn't purchase the original). On the other hand, certain other \"derivative works\" are not considered fair use, even though they may be at least somewhat \"commentative,\" and also have educational value. Why might that be?

Napoleon surrendered himself to the HMS Bellerophon on 15 July 1815. He was transported to the southern coast of England and eventually set sail for his imprisonment at St Helena on HMS Northumberland on 7 August. He reached St Helena on 1 October. I think two treaties are relevant. First, the Convention of St Cloud was signed on 7 July 1815. This signified the end of hostilities and allowed the British and Prussian troops to freely enter Paris. Napoleon surrendered himself after this date. More importantly (I think), the Treaty of Paris was signed by Britain and France on 20 November 1815. Article 10 of this stated: \u201cAll Prisoners taken during the hostilities, as well as all hostages which may have been carried off or given, shall be restored in the shortest time possible.\u201d A search of news stories in the London Times suggests in practice the British government did not start releasing French prisoners until late December 1815: \u201cGovernment gave directions in the course of last week, of the agents of the prison depots at Forton and Dartmoor (Captains MOTTLEY anti SHORTLAND) to provide vessels and send home all the French prisoners that are under their charge. Yesterday those in confinement at Forton commenced being shipped, either for Havre or Cherburgh. (The Times, 26 December 1815, p 3). The relevance of all this is that Napoleon arrived at St Helena on 1 October, BEFORE the Treaty of Paris was signed. Since St Helena belonged to the East India Company, I suspect the island lay outside the jurisdiction of British courts AFTER the Treaty was signed. In other words, once he had been taken there, the British authorities were no longer obliged to release him according to the terms of the Treaty of Paris. It may be that that this was an important motive for sending Napoleon to St Helena, not just because it was very isolated. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Before his arrival at St Helena, was Napoleon legally a prisoner of war?"}

Madison has been applied in a way that ignores a major caveat: a court's job is to say what the law is, which means that if the court is properly doing its job what the Court says and what the law is will be one and the same, but that will be because a Court that is doing its job will write a decision consistent with the law, not because the law magically changes to match what the Court says. Courts seem to feel a sense of duty to pretend that all previous decisions have been correct, no matter how insanely twisted the law would have to be to fit all past decisions. Much better would be to recognize that Supreme Court decisions might occasionally be wrong, but that would not prevent them from being binding upon the parties involved, or in some cases providing some level of protection from those would rely upon them. Historically, how willing has the US Supreme Court been to say that its previous decisions were wrong? How willing are US courts to say that previous discussions are right, even if they are inconsistent with current decision? How much of this attitude comes from the Marbury v.

I don't mean unfair) apply to workers who are not employees in England & Wales? My understanding from my lecturer is that it does apply (it came up on a test question which I got wrong for not saying workers could be wrongfully dismissed). However, I find this confusing because our reading material and the lecture slides only reference an employee being wrongfully dismissed. Example: In Introduction to Business Law (Lucy Jones, 5th Ed) it states: \"If an employer dismisses the employee without giving him the notice agreed in his contract, or dismisses him in breach of his contract in any other way, then this would be a wrongful dismissal.\u201d This paragraph is stated after making clear the difference between 'worker' and 'employee'. Namely that employees are a subset of workers and where employees have a contract of service, workers have a contract for service. I've also seen other sources which say wrongful dismissal happens when a term of an employment contract is broken. That also adds to the confusion since workers who are not employees don't have an employment contract. So if workers can be wrongfully dismissed, why do so many materials talk about employees rather than workers? (Computer Science is my main subject, not law, so I think I'm potentially missing some foundational knowledge that would make all this obvious.) \nTITLE: ", "output": "Can a worker who is not an employee be wrongfully dismissed?

I had a broadband internet connection and used a router provided by my ISP. Due to the lockdown, I had to move to my parents home in West Bengal, India (~1,660km/1,000m away). Since I have not renewed my internet connection in Chennai, the ISP has disconnected my internet connection and is demanding I return the router immediately. My home in Chennai is currently locked, so the only way to return the router is for me to travel back to Chennai, get my router, then return it to the ISP. It is not advised to travel during this lockdown so I cannot do anything. Also, I would need to stay under quarantine for at least 7 days if traveling to another state. Today I got a mail from my ISP threatening to take legal action against me if I do not return the router.

Suppose, a person P would like to create \"lecture notes\" based on a science textbook. The notes are meant to be used for private study and non-commercial research use only. A significant part of the content of the textbook expresses reasonably well-known ideas (i.e. other books that express similar ideas seem to exist) and P would not be copying the content word-for-word.

In our specific case, a copyright holder has provided work to us, licensed under the terms of GNU FDL 1.3. This license specifically allows licencees to redistribute, but limits relicensing of, the work. The copyright holder of the work wants to go on and sell this work to people under different licensing (as part of a book or somethin', so, incompatible with chapter 11). They're not looking to revoke our rights to the work, we know the license is irrevocable.

More specifically, I'm investigating how a number of low-skill, shift-work jobs in the United States, like fast food workers, retail employees, and cleaning staff, present frequent examples of workers being forced to work unusual hours and strange but not necessarily illegal working conditions under threat of firing. I've found numerous examples of employees of small restaurants, large and small retail, petrol station employees, and other shift work being hired on reasonable hours and working conditions, and then gradually being shifted to very inconvenient hours and threatened with working those hours or losing their positions. One man working as a line cook was scheduled to work four times a week, Mondays at night, Thursdays at night, Fridays during the day, and Saturdays during the day even though he specifically informed his employer he could not work on Saturdays as he had another job then. At risk of losing his job, he said he could possibly work every other Saturday, and was at once rescheduled for every other Saturday until the end of the shift schedule. In the coming weeks, the missing Saturdays were added to the schedule, and he now works every Saturday against his will. Because there are no obvious labor laws being broken, and the legal system is often financially inaccessible to the working-class employees of such businesses, this is rampant among certain American industries. My research now brings me to evaluating the laws that allow such conditions to flourish in the US, and I'm trying to decipher the equivalent laws in France as a comparison, which my research so far suggests that once hired, employees in France are significantly more difficult to remove than their contemporaries in the US.

On Sunday 1pm I went go to get some stuff from the truck and it was gone. After looking around I found small label with towing company information. At 3pm on Sunday I was at their lot getting my vehicle, I got into the vehicle and saw that it wasnt the same as I left and the dash cam that is attached to windshield was ripped off and swinging on the power cable. I asked the guy why they got into my vehicle and his response was that they need to disconnect the trailer from truck and tow the two pieces separately and then connect them back again at the lot. They billed me 1500 for the towing and service which they only wanted cash and didn't accept any card. I got the truck paid full amount in cash and have a receipt from them with all the info and charges. The owner (friend) of the restaurant showed me a video of them getting to my vehicle and driving off the plaza lot making a left turn into the main road at 2am Sunday morning. There is no tow truck in the video or someone disconnecting the trailer. You can clearly see a guy with something in his hand opening a door and 10 minutes later backing up and driving away and then a red pickup following him. What are my options here?

The title should be legally relevant, capture key aspects of the issue, and entice readers to learn more. \nQUESTION: Normally, the existence of prior art containing matters for which a United States utility patent makes claims to patent rights prevents a patent from being issued for those claims, and if a patent somehow issues anyway, it provides a defense to a defendant in a patent infringement action. But suppose that there exists prior art that is not know to anyone alive at the time that the patent is applied for and issued, but ten years later when the patent holder brings a timely patent infringement lawsuit, the prior art which had been unknown to anyone alive at the time is rediscovered. Does that invalidate the patent? Example For example, suppose that Sharp Co. develops a process of making steel for knives that is superior in some way (e.g., it makes it much cheaper and quicker to manufacture the knives than an alternative status quo process that produces exactly the same end result), by incorporating flax oil into the process of forging its knives. It is impossible to discern that the flax process was used by physically inspecting a knife made with it after the fact. Assume that this patent easily qualifies as valid by every relevant legal test evaluated as of 2012-2014 and under all changes to patent law since then that do not pertain to prior art. This process was something that no published work available to living people was aware of at the time that Sharp Co. applied for its patent in 2012, and the patent was issued in 2014. In time, Sharp Co. discovers that Dull Co., a company next door to it, is using the same flax oil process to forge its knives and brings suit in 2022 for patent infringement, having copied the Sharp Co. process from its patent application, and Dull Co. gains 50% of the market share of knives made with this process costing Sharp Co. US $50 million a year in lost profits. But after filing an answer in the patent infringement lawsuit in U.S. District Court, the patent infringement defense lawyer for Dull Co. who reads archaeology and linguistics texts in his spare time happens to learn that in 2016, archaeologists discovered an inscription in Old Persian from 1100 BCE in a newly unearthed tomb and translated it and published their findings in the journal Nature, describing precisely the same lost art of using flax oil to forge knives that Sharp Co. reinvented independently in 2012 and for which it secured its patent. No one affiliated of Sharp Co. learned about the newly discovered Old Persian texts until after they brought their infringement lawsuit and the lawyer for Dull Co. brought it to their attention. Dull Co.'s lawyer had raised the defense of invalidity based upon prior art in the answer that Dull Co. filed even though he didn't know about this particular prior art at the time. Evidence from the ancient Old Persian text and some related authentic texts written by Old Persian priests from a few centuries later indicates that there were hundreds of copies of the description of this process which were included in every prayer book of the predominant religion of the region now called Iran in 1100 BCE that was freely available in each of hundreds of temples in the region to anyone interested, but it was not preserved by later scribes who decided that it was considered an obvious piece of knowledge among metal workers that wasn't worth recopying at some point in the early Iron Age, even though they were wrong and the process was later entirely forgotten. Question Does the previously lost prior art, that is rediscovered before the patent of the lost prior art process expires, provide Dull Co. with a meritorious prior art invalidity defense to the validity of Sharp Co.'s patent infringement lawsuit against Dull Co.? I can imagine this question functionally hinging on when prior art has to exist, and I could also imagine it hinging on the definition of what has to happen for something to constitute prior art. But, I'm not really sure exactly what the proper analysis would be. Differences from prior similar questions This differs from the similar question \"What impact does prior art discovered after (US) patent awarding have on enforceability and even validity of that patent?\", because in this question, by design, there was nothing that would have operationally counted as prior art available at the time the patent was applied for and at the time that it was issued, while that question implicitly assumes that the only reason that prior art wasn't discovered was due to an inadequate prior art search when the patent was issued, and that a sufficiently thorough search for prior art at the time the patent was applied for and issued could have possibly found it. This also differs from the fact pattern where someone already uses the patented process in a secret manner protected as a trade secret that is not disclosed until after the patent is issued, because, as I understand it, to be prior art, something must be knowable to people in the general public at some prior time (usually in a publication that is not confidential). The example is loosely inspired by Rahil Alipour, Thilo Rehren, Marcos Martin\u00f3n-Torres. \"Chromium crucible steel was first made in Persia.\" Journal of Archaeological Science (2020); 105224 DOI: 10.1016/j.jas.2020.105224 (recounting their discovery that there was widespread manufacturing of chromium steel in Southern Persia around 1000 CE, a metallurgy technique that was subsequently lost and then only rediscovered about nine centuries later). \nTITLE: ", "output": "What is the effect of lost and recovered prior art on patent validity?"}

Am I legally required to continue reporting to my probation officer (regardless of whether the officer has acknowledged my release)? I am being supervised in a different state from my conviction. Background I live in (United States) state A, and was convicted of a crime in another state, state B. I was sentenced in state B to probation, and my supervision was transferred via the Interstate Compact to my home state, state A. My attorney filed a motion in state B requesting that my probation be terminated early. The judge granted our motion, thereby ending my state-mandated supervision. My question is: As soon as the judge signed the order granting my motion, am/was I legally finished with my responsibilities as a probationer? For example, can I stop reporting to my probation officer in my home state? Or must I wait for some official termination procedure to wend its way from the court, through the probation office in state B, over to the probation office in my home state A, after which I will presumably be told that I may stop reporting? What Actually Happened I sent a copy of the judge's order to my PO, and she said that before she can let me stop reporting, she needs to hear from state B's probation department telling her that my supervision has been terminated. (Via ICOTS, which I vaguely understand is some sort of communication portal for the Interstate Compact.) What she said makes complete sense to me and was not surprising. At the same time, though, once the judge has decreed my sentence to be over, isn't it over effective immediately? (Not that it has to necessarily be symmetric, but for what it's worth, my supervision began the very second the judge sentenced me; is it not logical to suppose that my supervision ends the very second the judge ends the sentence?) NOTE: FWIW, I'm not suggesting that I'll completely ghost my PO, even if the law says that I can. I don't want trouble, nor would I want to be rude to her. I just want to know my rights, both for my own curiosity and also in case things go south and I need to exercise them. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Judge granted me early discharge from probation; when can I stop reporting?"}

I do wonder whether the site disclaimer is sufficient to protect against a claim for incorrect advice however. Law Stack Exchange is for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for individualized advice from a qualified legal practitioner. Communications on Law Stack Exchange are not privileged communications and do not create an attorney-client relationship. It is also questionable as to whether professional indemnity insurance in the U.K. would cover a British lawyer sued in this way.

For example, let's imagine the police search a car and find an illegal item. The defendant makes a motion to have the evidence from the search suppressed on the grounds that the police had no probable cause to search the vehicle. Whether the police had probable cause in the case is complex issue involving many different facts. Let's imagine that one of these facts is that the police officer stated that the car owner's mechanic told him that the the car's airbag system had been tinkered with, a violation of US Federal regulations. During oral argument the defense argues that the possible violation of a Federal regulation is not grounds for a search. The judge then speaks out and says that violation of a regulation is still a crime and therefore potentially grounds for search. Later, in the written decision, the judge dismisses the motion to suppress, but does not explicitly give his reasons or gives other reasons, not involving the violation of a regulation. So, let's assume for the sake of argument that the judge made an error when he stated that violating a regulation is a \"crime\" and therefore grounds for local police to search a vehicle. Can the defense argue that even though this error does not appear in written form in the judge's decision, the fact that he said such a thing in court shows that he has a defective and incorrect understanding of laws relevant to the motion, therefore he is not fit to make a ruling on such laws. So, imagine that the appeals court finds that the judge has a clearly defective understanding of search and seizure law as evidences by his remarks in court. What is the outcome? Do they remand the case to the court, reverse the ruling, or take some other action? \nTITLE: ", "output": "If a judge evidences a misunderstanding of the law is that grounds for an appeal?"}

You agree to reimburse us for any payments made or loss suffered by us, whether in a court judgment or settlement, based on any matter covered by this Section 20. As written, this indemnification clause does not explicitly restrict itself to third-party claims, or to claims over something that's the user's fault. If I were to play this video game, almost anything I might want to sue this company over (or go to arbitration over, since there's an arbitration clause too) would be reasonably described as connected with: (a) your access to or use of the Services Even if I'm totally innocent and I'm trying to get compensation for something the company did wrong, anything wrong they did to me would almost certainly be connected to my use of the services.

A certain telecom company is advertising a \"7 Mb/s\" internet connection plan, and the monthly bill shows \"7.1 Mb/s\" internet service. When measured, connection speed is 3 Mb/s. Called customer service and found out that the contract for the \"7 Mb/s\" plan specifies that connection speed may vary between 3 and 7 Mb/s, and, what surprised me most, I was told that customers in my area are \"allocated 3.3 Mb/s\". That is, the allocated bandwidth is fixed at 3.3 Mb/s and doesn't really vary between 3 and 7, and most certainly can never reach the advertised 7 Mb/s. I wonder whether this practice is legal. Can a baker advertise a 7 lbs cake, bill for 7.1 lbs cake, mention in the contract that the actual weight of the cake may vary between 3 and 7 lbs, and fine tune its machinery to always produce 3.3 lbs cakes to be sold as the 7.1 lbs ones?

Personal or household activities could include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or social networking and online activity undertaken within the context of such activities. What information do we have to determine what counts as \"a purely personal or household activity\"? Data processing tools available to the individual have become much more powerful in recent years, and it seems this is likely to increase rapidly in the near future. Last year I thought the most powerful tools available to anyone that had the potential to break the GDPR were bellingcat's tools for building personal network graphs from public information such as social media and Companies House. However in the last month open source tools derived from Meta\u2019s LLaMA Large Language Model have improved to the point that they are competitive with the best in the world and Google expects them to eclipse this performance in coming months. For example Vicuna-13B runs on a reasonable gaming computer and when asked \"tell me about [FIRST SURNAME] from [INSTITUTION]\" will provide a mostly inaccurate paragraph that includes some true personally identifiable information. This works for me and some others who have a web presence such as have published peer reviewed literature but are not in any way famous. They have an online demo that requires no registration, you can try it yourself here. It seems at the very least it would be challenging to justify the use of such a tool under the GDPR. As I understand it all the information within the network is used to answer every question, even if just as far as \"do not use this bit of the network\". Therefore any use could be classed as the processing of personal data. Therefore if one wanted to download and experiment with such a model the easiest way would be to rely on the Household Activities exception. However it is not totally clear what would and would not be counted. What information could we use to try and determine if such a use was legal, and what the limits would be? Previous Reaserch The ICO has a page on the exceptions but that explicitly does not cover domestic purposes: \"This is simply because they are not covered by the UK GDPR\". It gives the topic two sentences, the first repeats the law and the second give a couple of examples that are not relevant here. There is a denied FOI request for \"any policy, guidance, lines-to-take or other material you hold on the scope of the exemption contained in GDPR art 2(2)(c) and/ or recital 18\" with the denial based on this information appearing in guidance including \"a final published version\". However I cannot find this guidance with either Google or the ICO website search. There is a case from the Netherlands that excludes posting photos of one's child on social media from the household use exception. While this may not directly relate to my question, it does illustrate the the exception can be interpreted quite narrowly. It rather surprised me as posting photos of one's children seems to be quite a big bit of social media. \nTITLE: ", "output": "What does \"Household Exception\" to the GDPR mean?"}

However, in other parts of the country, merchants are allowed to charge automatically after a free trial period. So most companies make the terms and conditions that one agrees on say that the charge will be automatic after the free trial period for most of the country, but make it clear the terms are different for Quebec. Some companies have not done this, and automatically charge people, even though it's not allowed (the terms and conditions go against regulations).

The premise I am operating under is that, a), while there are limits to this, border agents can demand passwords to phones, laptops or similar devices, and b), you face annoying to potentially serious consequences (being detained, not allowed to enter the US, and/or having your device confiscated for a period of time or indefinitely). I don't have what I would consider sufficient sources for this information (i.e. for documenting what is actually legal*, certainly there are many sources documenting that such events have occurred). *I am aware that the law in this case may change or become more clearly defined, as matters seem to have a degree of fuzziness now. All of that out of the way, consider somebody (a US citizen) crossing the US border who, knowing they might be stopped and asked for their password by border agents, set an unusually long password. Specifically, one occupying several letter-sized pages. When asked for their password, they provide a pre-printed copy of this password (the rationale is that typing such a password would likely take many attempts and be highly irritating, since you cannot see mistakes on most computer login screens - the individual perhaps intends this to be a protest). What, if any, legal consequences could result from doing this? I am aware that there are significant risks of practical consequences resulting from this, such as being detained regardless of law, however, I am interested in the legal aspect. In a different scenario, someone (again a US citizen) chooses to instead infect their computer with malware which is programmed to spread to any connected devices (say, if border agents connect USB devices with forensic tools to collect data). Perhaps this person too thinks of this as a protest. What are the potential legal consequences of doing this? I should specify that while I am somewhat flexible with my language by saying \"potential\" consequences, an answer merely stating the relevant computer misuse laws for the latter, or failure-to-comply laws for the former isn't exactly what I am looking for - I am interested in an analysis that specifically accounts for the context of these border searches.

Let's suppose there is a software at version a1 in code repository A on an online code hosting website. Let's suppose the original author updated it and made a version a2, then a3. Another person comes along, forked a1 to another code repository B, then modified it resulting their own b2, then modified b2 again and resulted in b3. All versions are available online - a1, a2, b2 are available in the code commit history, and a3, b3 are available on the home page. a1 -- a2 -- a3 `-- b2 -- b3 Question: how many derivative works of the software exist in this scenario? My initial instinct is one, because there is the original code repository A, and a forked-and-modified repository B which is the derivative work. But I realized the answer might be four (that is, a2, a3, b2, b3 all count as derivative works of the original code -- but not sure), given that in the copyright law (using US copyright law as an example): A \u201cderivative work\u201d is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a \u201cderivative work\u201d. The definition given in the Apache 2.0 license is more direct: \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. I think a key point a software is different from a book/painting/movie is that software is very much a \"live\" thing - that is, software is constantly being updated after being \"published\".

For example, in Massachusetts the law (General Laws Part III Title I Chapter 214) reads: The supreme judicial court, upon request of a party to a civil action in which equitable relief is sought, may frame issues of fact to be tried by a jury and order the same to be tried in that court or in the superior court in the county in which such cause is pending, or upon the request of all parties in any other county. Which gives the impression that trial is by jury and the jury has the full power over the trial. However, if we read General Laws Part III Title I Chapter 218 19B, we find something different, at least for district courts: (c) The justice presiding over a jury of 6 session shall have and exercise all powers and duties which a justice sitting in the superior court department has and may exercise in the trial and disposition of civil cases including the power to report questions of law to the appeals court. Trials by juries of 6 shall proceed in accordance with the law applicable to trials by jury in the superior court;... So, now all of a sudden, we have a \"justice\" that has some kind of power, but that power is undefined except that is the \"same\" as the power of a superior court justice. If we then refer to the conduct of the superior court, it reads ( General Laws Part III Title I Chapter 212 Section 2): The court shall be held by one of the justices, and when so held shall have and exercise all the power and jurisdiction committed to said court. The chief justice shall make such assignments for the attendance of a justice at the several times and places appointed for holding the court as will be most convenient and as will insure the prompt performance of its duties. So, here it says the court is held by the justice, not by the jury. If we then refer to the \"powers\" of the Superior Court, it reads in part as follows ( General Laws Part III Title I Chapter 213 Section 3: Rules; power to make and promulgate): The courts shall, respectively, make and promulgate uniform codes of rules, consistent with law, for ... Second, Prescribing the terms upon which amendments will be allowed or unnecessary counts and statements stricken from the record; discouraging negligence and deceit; preventing delay; securing parties from being misled; placing the party not in fault as nearly as possible in the condition in which he would have been if no mistake had been made; distinguishing between form and substance; and substituting fixed and certain requirements for the discretion of the court. Third, Conducting trials. Fourth, Presenting distinctly the questions to be tried by the jury. Fifth, Giving a party such notice of the evidence which is intended to be offered by the adverse party as will prevent surprise and enable him to prepare for trial. Sixth, Prescribing such forms of verdicts as will place upon record the finding of the jury. So, by this Superior Court apparently can boss around the jury however it likes, so long as it is according to \"rules\" (not laws) which it must \"promulgate\". So, my question is, if we are not dealing in law anymore but in \"rules\" concocted by the Superior Court: (a) where are these \"rules\"? (at least in the case of Massachusetts) (b) since the original jurisdiction seems to be vested in a \"justice\" not a jury, should I consider the statements concerning \"trial by jury\" to be just mistatements and that the jury does not have original jurisdiction in Massachusetts in any court, but that it is always the judge that has original jurisdiction? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Do judges in Massachusetts always have original jurisdiction even in \"trials by jury\"?"}

In Dutch copyright law there's the notion of portrait rights. This law specifies certain restrictions for the author of a photo/drawing/painting/sculpture/etc and rights for the person in the art piece. For this to count as a portrait, it says that it doesn't necessarily need to show the face. It is enough if the person is recognizable, for instance from other body features, iconic clothing or posture. I was wondering, with the internet being a thing, if this recognizability requirement extends to alter-egos/personas/main oc/etc. They and their likeness and character traits are a recognizable characteristic of the person behind that persona. For example, if you have an account on a certain website (say YouTube or DeviantART) where you always represent yourself with a certain character (for avatars, emoticons, profile pictures, etc), instead your own photo. This character is uniquely used as an identifiable character by you (so not something like a character from a movie or a game). You then commission someone to make a drawing of this character for yourself. Do portrait rights apply in this case? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Dutch Portrait rights for persona"}

Great Legal Cases and How They Shaped the World (2011) by Allan C.

It has everything to do with the changing currents and concerns in the contemporary political context. Plessy\u2019s separate-but-equal dogma ceased to be a fixed point on the constitutional compass because it no longer enjoyed sufficient political confidence and public support, at least among the elite. When Justice Harlan in 1896 predicted in his dissent that the Plessy judgment \u201cwill, in time, prove to be quite as pernicious as the decision in Dred Scott,\u201d he was talking about its substantive merits as a political outcome, not its formal qualities as a legal judgment.

After 5 months, this product became defective, and was exchanged for another identical product. Upon exchange, I was provided with a new order number and confirmation email for the new product.

There is a retaining wall between the two properties. We have checked on the county assessor's website and the retaining wall is entirely on their side of the property line, and the neighboring property is lower and was excavated to be level, creating the need for the retaining wall. Based on all of that, it is my current understanding that it is the responsibility of the neighbor to maintain the retaining wall, which is over 30 years old, wood, and crumbling to the point that there are large sections of exposed dirt currently being held up by nothing. The problem is, despite the tenant in the house telling us that about a year before we bought the property the landlord had an estimator out to look at it, and more recently she told us they said that they'd have another estimate done over a month ago, nothing has happened. I have had to brace the fence to keep it from falling over as the dirt around the fence posts erodes away. The property management company / owner are very unresponsive and do not seem very keen on repairs based on the visible condition of the property (rotting window frames) and the tenant telling us about other repairs she has requested not being done. I had even contacted a few companies to see about doing the repairs myself but they declined as they could not get the permits as the work would not be on my property. I have set aside some money to cover probably the entire cost of the work, and definitely half, but as this is a rental and therefore the owner is profiting from it, I would only want to help pay for their maintenance as a last resort if they ask for it. There are other repairs to our own home we could use that money for as well as we bought this as a bit of a fixer upper.

Some people are claiming that this violates 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 597 (Expenditures to influence voting): Whoever makes or offers to make an expenditure to any person, either to vote or withhold his vote, or to vote for or against any candidate; It seems to me that this is not a violation of that law, since the organization neither requires that the felon vote for a specific candidate nor even that they vote at all. However, I am not a lawyer. There's also the Florida law Title IX Chapter 104 Section 061 (2): No person shall directly or indirectly give or promise anything of value to another intending thereby to buy that person\u2019s or another\u2019s vote or to corruptly influence that person or another in casting his or her vote.

In other criminal cases: an intoxicated person cannot use drunkenness as a defense against their actions. I find it contradictory that a person who is unable to make decisions about their own sexual behavior due to intoxication may still be held accountable for criminal acts committed during that time. Surely, if a person cannot make decisions about their own body while intoxicated, they should also not be held responsible for crimes committed during that same time period? How do prosecutors typically handle cases involving alcohol? Is there a specific threshold for determining when someone is too drunk to be held responsible for their actions? Do prosecutors rely on blood alcohol level tests to determine a person's level of intoxication, or do they make a judgment based on the circumstances of the case? \nTITLE: ", "output": "How drunk is too drunk?

Beethoven is long dead, so the symphony is public domain (to my understanding). However, before anyone can make a full copy, a US-based company buys the manuscript and puts it in a vault. They have an orchestra under NDA make recordings, and sell those recordings, which are then restricted. Because everyone wants to hear Beethoven's 10th, they make a ton of money out of royalties. But, a team of music enthusiasts and Beethoven scholars around the world collaborate and they transcribe their legally purchased recordings, to reconstruct the sheet music. It won't be an exact copy, but it will be really close. Is this 'Reverse Engineered Beethoven's 10th' in the public domain if the transcribers designate it so? Can they put it on imslp, and can other companies record it and sell those recordings, use it in movies, and so forth? The core question; can you produce PD content based on copyrighted works that were based on PD content? But, one extra wrinkle in that unlike the similar question about copyrighted photo material, a recording of this symphony would be an artistic rendition of the symphony, not an objective one. There might even be slight mistakes like a flat note that should be a sharp, which the reverse engineered version would also have (and the original 10th wouldn't). \nTITLE: ", "output": "Can you legally reconstruct public domain content from copyrighted works based on public domain works?"}

When the person goes to seek a remedy, can they make their initial pleading in a Federal district court, or will the judge of the district court require that the complaint be made first in the state where the alleged violation occurred?

It's primarily for research purposes. I know that in order to be GDPR compliant, this data has to be anonymized. Furthermore, I know the difference between pseudonymization (the data is anonymized but the process can be reversed, e.g. encryption and the corresponding key is kept elsewhere) and anonymization (data is anonymized and there is no \"direct\" way to infer the initial state from the end state). However, what I have yet to find out is when to use which. Since the latter most likely yields greater information loss I am more inclined to use the former. However, if pseudonymization is sufficient then why would one use anonymization instead? I have a suspicion that it may come down to whether a company has the resources to put additional effort into making sure that, in case of the example above, the encryption key is well protected. When it does not it might just want to anonymize the data and \"be done with it\".

He finds it at a web store in Spain for a good price. They ship internationally: shipping cost is automatically calculated upon providing an address. Bob, happy with all the costs, places an order and pays by credit card. The card gets actually charged. A few days later, when the purchase already appears finished on the card's online statement, the store emails Bob: shipping cost to NZ is triple the one you've paid. Do you wanna pay the difference or cancel the order and get the refund? What does the Spanish law say about situations like this? Is the store obliged to honour the contract and ship at the original cost, or is there no contract (only invitation to treat)?

Before I left I was operating a small business with a close family member, they were taking care of the accounting/tax issues with their close accountant. I did not care to check very extensively about any wrong doings because they were family and I could not comprehend a fraudalent action on their behalf (never do this kids). Long story short I have discovered the following: 1) Without my knowledge or consent they opened a bank account and gave two checks worth 16.000 euros. Of course the money did not exist in the bank, the checks were denied, I was procecuted and trialed without me knowing everything or attending a trial. This happened more than 5 years ago, I did not know it because the mail was stolen from my house at that period from the same person. Everything was forged and nothing bears my signature 2) Some debts on my behalf were created to vendors, debt recognition forms were signed on my behalf, I have never seen or signed those papers 3) Taxes of almost 30.000 euros were unpaid. Now some good things 1) Proving the forgery I assume should be easy, I write with my left and the signatures do not resemble mine at all, they do not even exist in my official documents, my signature is totally different 2) The person who did this (as I learned recently) has been convicted of forgery and usury 10 years back and my record (besides these) is clean. Plus my job is totally different at this point and I can provide my paychecks which will definetely show that I was in no need of any kind of financial assistance for many years (remote worker with western European salary in eastern Europe) 3) There are many clients who are willing to testify that they have never seen me, and vendors, and that they have been dealing with that person for the entirety of their transactions 4) They have unknowledged on emails their guilt (by starting to pay off the debt in the tax services) My questions mostly have to do whether these actions will have an impact in my life in this country which I have strived to build: 1) Can the tax services in countryA confiscate accounts that are opened in countryB by me? 2) Do you think based on these that I have case?

Thus the ten provinces and three territories are here being considered \"adminstrative divisions\". Maybe a year or so ago I was appalled to see this Wikipedia article telling us that states in the United States are administrative divisions of the country, and I changed it. In the U.S. there were formerly \"organized incorporated territories\" (and maybe the District of Columbia could still be considered one of those?).

During the existence of such a territory, if it was decided to change the term served by the governor from two years to fours year, or make some other change, the change was enacted by Congress, not by the voters in the territory. The constitution of a state, by contrast, is drafted by politicians in that state and submitted for the approval of the voters, and any changes are made by popular vote; there is no involvement of Congress or anything at the federal level. Thus states are not administrative divisions of the federal government. Counties, in those states where they exist (or parishes in Louisiana or boroughs in Alaska), are administrative divisions of the state. Thus it seems appropriate that in the U.S., states get \"admitted\" by Congress whereas territories get \"organized\" by Congress. However, in Canada, if I'm not mistaken, both provinces and territories get \"admitted\". So Is this understanding of the concept of \"administrative division\" right? Is the article about Quebec right? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Are Canadian provinces and territories administrative divisions, and what is an \"adminstrative division\"?"}

The scenario is: A group of four people, created a hair/fashion show - organising and planning all aspects, inclusive of hair/clothes/music/inspiration. Meaning the entire collection, was of their own idea, and creation. Outfits were purchased by these four people, and needed some modification, (modifications being some illustrations applied). so under recommendation from a friend an individual (The Designer), offered this service without any discussion or need for payment. The Designer was provided with all materials needed to do this, as to not incur any cost to themselves, also given a brief and reference images to use to ensure the end result was as excepted and fitted with the overall collection. These outfits (and now modifications), became part of the final 'collection', which is owned by that of the 4 who orchestrated it. My question is: Where the work is of the designers hand, but was only created by them after being provided all materials, and a brief with reference images, not of their own ideas.

It could be a lot but I have no idea my sister is the executor of the will and she has not told me anything but wait. The money is suppose to be split into 3 equal shares. It\u2019s has been over 4 months and still no update. I knew I would have to wait but I assumed I would at least know something by now. I have requested an update on multiple occasions but she is stonewalling me. We don\u2019t get along especially after I found out my sister didn\u2019t honor my moms wish to be bairred in the plot that my mom picked out and purchased, instead having her cremated which allowed my sister to sell the plot. Mom mother had already sold her house and I think the money was in a brokerage account that they were drawing from to pay her bills. She was living in assisted living so we owe some money to Medicaid $60k but the rest is ours to split. I\u2019m not sure if probate is involved or not. One of the stipulation of my moms will is that we cannot fight over the money or we are out of the will. Does that give my sister carte blache to do as she pleases? I don\u2019t know what I can do or say without it being considered arguing and forfeit my share of the money. This doesn\u2019t seem right but I don\u2019t know. Any advice would be appreciated.

When she was looking and posting her job profile, someone contacted her. Some guy contacted her via Whatsapp and asked her if she was looking for a job, and of course she said yes.

My whole family is very supportive of this org. By taking this job, I was fulfilling not only my own dreams, but those of my family to help make my country a better place. On 11/13, I had to resign from my job... and I'm not blameless here unfortunately... This month, the org rolled out a new strategy nationwide and we (our attorneys) filed several lawsuits in support of this strategy. My boss tasked me with providing analyses (I was working as a data scientist) to back up a couple of the lawsuits. They'd already been filed, so I just needed to back up the claims our attorneys made in court. The problems started here. I couldn't find anything to back up those claims... I tried umpteen transformations, slicing the data every which way and came up with nothing they could use. I told my boss I couldn't find anything. But he and his boss both insisted I must be able to find something. So I figured it was a test. I was on a contract ending 11/30 and I thought maybe they were trying to decide which contractors to keep on. The next day or day after I was able to put something together... but there's a problem... Our attorneys alleged in court that fraudulent activities occurred in one region, and I had to merge data from another, entirely different region to make it appear that fraudulent activities occurred... to show a discrepancy when there was actually none... meaningless analysis akin to showing that there is more gas in the tank of an F-150 than capacity in the tank of a Focus--even if it's technically true, it's not evidence of illegal activity whatsoever. I tried to explain this to my boss... I started the explanation but he cut me off... he told me I had done great work and said he didn't care how I got there. I tried to interject... but I couldn't get a word in... I know I messed up really bad... right away a knot formed in my stomach... I haven't been able to sleep properly since. The next day was Friday the 13th as it would happen, I resigned with two weeks notice for courtesy... per the org's data protection procedures, they pay me for two weeks but I was immediately dismissed. ie I didn't have access to any of the org's data after I resigned. I'm still terrified... Does it sound like I did anything illegal? I think this court case may have been dismissed already, if it was dismissed, does that mean I could still be charged with something? Or am I safe now? And now I keep thinking of other things... in the first week of November, I accidentally discovered a discrepancy between the org's internal data feed and the public data feed. The public feed is used by our competitors and government agencies, so any discrepancy is pretty serious. Based on our internal data feed, our attorneys were alleging that a single anomalous activity occurred at a specific time... but the public data feed showed instead a series of normal activities occurring over a wider period of time. I stumbled upon this discrepancy by accident--I was using the public data feed for another, unrelated analysis--but I notified my boss immediately... my boss only told me that he was \"aware of the discrepancy\". Later, we (our attorneys) built a court case based on the internal data feed... I didn't work on that case, but I knew we submitted inaccurate and made false claims... Now I can think of other instances like this too... I just don't know what to do... should I get a lawyer?

I liked the presentation and expressed willingness to look over the agreement and consider the offer. After a short time I decided it wasn't a good fit, and expressed that to the consulting firm, at which point I noticed some poignant changes in their communications with me. Language in their emails went from what I'll call \"business casual\" to a more carefully worded tone, with word choices that left room for ambiguity when making statements, but demanded absolute answer when asking questions. Appearance of what I'll call \"threats by reticence\" in verbal dialogue, where scenarios would be presented describing negative outcomes to our negotiations that weren't overtly threatening, but deliberately ended with phrases like \"we'll see...\" or \"doesn't look good...\" And the main hint in this interaction: the consulting firm began including the same text content that was contained in the email as a signed pdf on their firm's letterhead, attached to the email. My suspicion is that this is an attempt to construct a narrative for litigation purposes, creating a paper trail outside of their company email account so that they can limit what they'd have to disclose in the discovery phase. I don't have a lawyer, I can't afford one right now, and don't feel threatened enough to need one. But I am curious if my intuition is right.

Note the following excerpt with certain keywords I have highlighted in bold... It was equally desirable, that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations. I believe (though I may be in error) the courts have in the past looked to the Federalist Papers, along with the minutes and other writings from the Constitutional Convention of 1787 to determine the Framer's intent. (sub question) Is anyone here familiar with details of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 enough to know if there is any corroboration with the purpose of the electors as described in F.P. #68 ? THE FULL QUESTION So, here is the full question. If the founding fathers indeed wanted us to have an electoral college that was an active, reasoning, and deliberative body, could it be submitted to a court that any electors who affirm they believe that they were appointed to perform \"strictly a ceremonial function\" and that they intend to do just that are not qualified for and/or not fulfilling the obligations of the office to which they were elected? PS: I believe this is called \"non-feasance\" in legal terms. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Can presidential electors be challenged for performing \"strictly a ceremonial function\"?"}

We are also on a discord server with some friends, where we talk about the game. Note: this is a privatly run server and has no affilation with the game, the mods or anyone besides us. One of the Admins posted something along the lines of: \"Don't generalise. \"Only the sith deal in absolutes\" may be from sci-fi, but there's a very real truth to it. Bad cops suck.

However, assume for this example that the owner did have standing (permission and licensing) to build the improvement. DaleM indicated that the Association now owns said improvement.

DaleM indicated: A deck is normally fixed to the land in some more or less permanent fashion. That makes it a fixture, and fixtures, unlike chattels, have no property independent of the land they are part of. The part of the deck on the common property of the HOA belongs to the HOA. DaleM correctly surmises that the improvement is a fixture. IANAL, so I seek to understand: Because the fixture-improvement (wooden deck) is on the common property, the HOA owns it.

I don't know the individual. The two letters were dated about 1 month apart. The return address had my street address on it, but claimed that it was sent from \"an agent of\" some financial services company X. I did not open the letters.

The debt collector does not understand the law, or understands it all-too-well, and wants to mask their physical location to protect themselves against a retaliation. The wrong return address was not printed on the letters by mistake. Since the entity sending the letters purports to be a services company, it sends a lot of them. If there was a mistake, it would have been fixed over the period of a full month. My concern is that whoever is receiving the letters (unlike the ones which were returned to me as \"undeliverable\"), may be unstable and potentially dangerous.

It revolves around the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and activity of USAMRIID on US Soil and whether legally they can be deployed or can act within the United States in the event of a major viral outbreak or other type of situation where they and their scientists are the 'front lines' of a major Biosafety Level 3/4 outbreak domestically. Origin of the Question A 1995 movie called \"Outbreak\" details a fictional viral outbreak of an infinitely lethal pathogen. This pathogen essentially infects an entire town and USAMRIID and US Military are deployed to cordon off the town and act alongside CDC to help identify and then attempt to create an antigen for this fictional pathogen. However, there was a US Army military cordon used in the movie to isolate the affected town. Two seasons of a series called \"The Hot Zone\" exist (based on actual real life events, i.e. Ebola Reston and Amerithrax responses and investigations), the first one detailing the Ebola Reston situation where there was an Ebola outbreak in Reston at an animal quarantine place holding monkeys. USAMRIID deployed during that first season to sterilize the facility, neutralize the monkeys, and get samples of Ebola Reston to USAMRIID for study. They operated as a military operation to get in, sterilize the threats, and get out without being seen, however as everyone involved was USAMRIID, they were technically military, so it stands to reason they are not permitted to deploy domestically. The Question We know that the Posse Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1385) limits the ability for the federal government to deploy US military personnel to enforce domestic laws and policies within the US. However, while USAMRIID is a US Military operation out of Fort Detrick, there still seems to be a lot of movies showing USAMRIID deploying in response to domestic biosafety level 3 and level 4 situations, adn then in turn acting in regards to those situations. I know these movies are dramatizations, and not based in actual US legal cases at times, however I know that USAMRIID along with CDC personnel were involved in eradicating the Ebola Reston 'outbreak' before it spread beyond the quarantine facility. Does USAMRIID operate outside the Posse Comitatus Act, in that they can coordinate and act on US soil in response to biological threat situations, or are they bound by Posse Comitatus and are not allowed to act to enforce biosafety in the event of outbreaks of BL4 agents like ebola or other filoviruses? This question is looking for answers based in law and precedent related to Posse Comitatus and whether it affects USAMRIID specific activities states-side in response to biosafety situations. Precedents to support statements are desired in this case. \nTITLE: ", "output": "USAMRIID is US Military - are they allowed to deploy domestically contrary to Posse Comitatus in response to biological outbreaks?"}

Real estate appears to be the only asset recorded, ever. Upon each parent's death, their wills were poured over into the trust to handle non-real-estate assets (autos and such), and B1 received everything. (Not sure if the wills of either parent were ever recorded when they died, but maybe that's moot). B1, who was also a trustee, eventually died and left the home and belongings (cited in the parents' pourover wills) in the trust. B1 wrote their last instructions on their own; no lawyer or witnesses involved. It was typed but in great detailed, was hand-signed and dated, and there is ample extrinsic evidence to show B1's intent. Indeed, B1's instructions were essentially the same as in the trust: I'm dead, divide everything among B2, B3, etc. So, B1 owned the home and kept it in the trust. The value is more than allowed for a small affidavit, but that is apparently moot anyway because the home remained in the trust. Yes? B1's bank accounts and insurance polices were ToD (nonprobate). B1's probate assets were very old car, very old furniture, very old etc., certainly worth less than $42K. Some of the current beneficiaries are also co-successor trustees. The home will be sold. There are no family disputes to settle. All known creditors have been notified.

Other examples of this: 17 USC \u00a7101 through \u00a7122, followed immediately by \u00a7201 to \u00a7205; 22 USC \u00a7 1 through \u00a7136, followed immediately by \u00a7141 to \u00a7183; 18 USC \u00a7 2381 through \u00a7 2391, followed immediately by \u00a7 2421 to \u00a7 2429. 51 USC \u00a7 10101 followed by \u00a7 20101, \"implying\" they skipped 10,100 sections (except they didn't). Second, why do certain portions of the US Code look like, well, these oddly listed names? Did Congress just run out of numbers or were they trying to \"squeeze an entirely new section\" in but couldn't quite make it? 16 USC \u00a7470x-6, \u00a7 470aaa, \u00a7 590z-11, \u00a7668ss 15 USC \u00a777bbbb, 79z-6, 80b-21 22 USC \u00a72799aa-2 42 USC \u00a7300mm-62, 1397mm, 2000aa-5, 2000bb-4, 2000gg-6 To me the US Code looks like, well, spaghetti code.

The Good Behaviour Clause of the Constitution says: The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour.... It is said that this was intended to mean that federal judges should have life tenure ... but I cannot find a reference for that (and in fact the link I posted never quote anything from the framers which would suggest that this clause was intended as a guarantee of life tenure to federal judges). To me the clause would mean that they can stay in office until they show \"good behaviour\", that is, until and unless they are impeached. Can Congress approve a statue which says that all federal judges will stay in Office for 5 years? If not, what provisions would that status violates and why? I don't interpret the Good Behaviour Clause as implying that judges will hold their offices for all their lives unless impeached. It only says that they stay in office until impeached, without specifying how long they stay in office. \nTITLE: ", "output": "What law grants life tenure to federal judges in the US?"}

It was out of battery, so what I wanted to do was take it home, charge it, and then see if we could call someone to get the phone back. In fact, I have lost my phone before and this is exacttly what some stranger did. However, it was pointed out to me today that I could be legally responsible if I take an item home that isn't mine, even if my intention is to return it to its owner. Is it true anywhere in the United States that I could face legal consequences for taking home someone's lost item, intending to get it returned to them? What if I don't intend to return it? Finders keepers? To be safe, I dropped it off at a police station instead, but the police there did not respond very well. They seemed annoyed that we brought the phone in, and did not have a designated lost-and-found. Given their response, I would be more confident that the phone would be returned if I had taken it home myself. Related (not duplicate) questions Is it legal to stop somebody taking your stuff if you've left it somewhere? Most of the things here are about what you can do to someone who is trying to take your item. However, the answer does state this: The phone in question has been mislaid and anyone who finds it has a duty to deliver it to the owner of the bench for safekeeping pending the true owner's return: if the owner does not return within a reasonable time the phone becomes the property of the bench owner (e.g. the city that owns the park). Perhaps this applies here and it is not allowed to take it home, only to return it to the owner of the property on which it was left. Can a store sell merchandise I've left in the store? The answer explains that there is a distinction between lost, mislaid, and abandoned. This distinction probably applies here, but I do not know whether it is legal to take a lost, mislaid, or abandoned object home in order to try to identify its owner. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Is it illegal to take home a lost phone?"}

In particular, the question I'm asking here came about because I was set to go ahead with a company funded masters project writing code and developing algorithms. The IP agreement for this project felt so restrictive to me that I (sadly) ended up declining the project. It essentially said that all copyright, patents, know-how, etc. would belong to the company. The main reason I declined was because I thought it could give me problems later on if I were to work for a different company applying similar algorithms, potentially for a similar purpose. For argument sake, let's say there were no patents; would I be able in the future to write code for another company that used similar algorithms, expressed in slightly different terms (noting that there only so many ways you can actually code up these algorithms)? As an aside, I'd love if you could give me, someone just starting in industry, some advice on how to navigate this topic of IP, especially noting that these contracts can feel rather vague/ambiguous as to what you're actually allowed to do after completing the project.

I found out that my foreign driver's license was not good enough since I had lived in the country for too long (I had borrowed a friend's car and didn't know I wasn't allowed to drive), so the insurance won't pay.

After this lead to degraded performance at work, we obtained legal consultation which advised us to terminate the lease since the landlord did not provide a safe and habitable environment (State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.00) which we did. The landlord, a property management, did not agree with this, did not refund us our security deposit despite no issues with the apartment, and wanted us to pay the rent until they find a new renter which we declined. We think they also did not immediately advertise the apartment as for rent as it did not show up on their website. After some months, we were contacted by a debt collector, asking us to pay two months of rent. We told them the claim was invalid for the reasons stated above, but they said they will report the claim to credit agencies as disputed. We don't want this issue to adversely affect our credit and got legal consulting which suggested we should pay the debt collector to protect our credit score, and then sue the landlord for the money back in small claims court.

To recap, I'm writing some (open source) software that talks to some hardware. The communication is encrypted, but I managed to find the encryption key in their app. I know I can't distribute the key, but can I give people instructions on how to find the key? I was planning on making it step-by-step (e.g. \"go to app-downloader.example.com, type in 'com.example.app', download the file, upload it to app-decompiler.example.xyz and look in path/to/private.key\"), but also wondered itf it was better to scale it back (e.g. \"download the app, decompile it, look in there for the password\"). I plan to chat to a lawyer when it comes closer to release time, but for now, I'd like to know if I should put the effort in documenting the process or not. EDIT: To further clarify, my app's purpose is to achieve interoperability, or in this case, operability. The app which houses the private key is literally unusable -- I've made 30+ attempts and tried three different phones and their app won't connect to their hardware. Many others are experiencing the same (1.6/5 stars on Google Play, 16 1-star reviews out of 24 total). Early signs tells me that my code could connect, providing I can encrypt and decrypt the information necessary. Support is non-existent (they stopped replying to comments mid last year, and no updates in that long either). U.S. Code \u00a7 1201 - Circumvention of copyright protection systems tells me that: Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), a person who has lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a computer program may circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a particular portion of that program for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and that have not previously been readily available to the person engaging in the circumvention So as far as I can tell, I'm within my rights to create the code, as my goal is to achieve interoperability, by letting users control this hardware (a Chinese version of a Belkin WeMo WiFi switch) with their home automation system. So my goal isn't to \"stand outside a bank at midnight and offer to give away the access code to the front doors\", but rather to stand out the front of a bank during opening hours and show them how to operate the door when they can't get in, and the bank refuses to fix the door. EDIT 2: Since then, I've discovered that I can make this key extraction process even more generic. The app can be freely downloaded from their website. If I download it, read a single file in there and tell my computer to find anything that is 16 alphanumeric characters long in that file (the encryption type they use states that the password MUST be 16 characters long), then it can find it. So now that's what I'm attempting to focus on, because I don't need to distribute anything, I just need to write code to download the file from their public website, pull out all the 16-character long strings from the file (there are a few) and try each key until the correct one is found. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Can I distribute instructions on how to extract a private key?"}

As an article in Bloomberg explains: The long-term implications of Proposition 22 are profound, advocates say, because of strict\u2014and by their account, unprecedented\u2014lock-in measures: If approved by voters, the measure could only be amended with a 7/8 majority of state legislators. \u201cIn practical terms, this means there will likely be enough votes to permanently prevent amendments,\u201d reads the report. Any future amendments deemed inconsistent with the purpose of the proposition\u2014meaning anything that challenges independent contractor status\u2014will be prohibited, according to the researcher\u2019s interpretation of the measure. This measure appears to make it unrealistic for this proposition to ever be modified or repealed, and I am wondering whether it is legal for a California law to entrench itself in such a way. Specific related questions are: Can the proposition be repealed by a simple majority of California voters through a future ballot initiative? Can the proposition be repealed by a 2/3 legislative majority who would legislate its repeal through a change to the California state constitution? (Such changes can be made by a 2/3 majority, to my understanding.) If the answer to 2 is \"yes\", doesn't that mean that the 7/8 majority restriction is legally meaningless and that the clause with that language should not have been allowed on the ballot by the California state official who is in charge of such things (the Secretary of State, I'm guessing)? Is there anything special about the number 7/8? That is, can a future ballot initiative include a similar condition in which the number 7/8 is replaced by 99/100? Or by an absolute prohibition on the law it institutes ever being repealed by the legislature?

The features I want to implement, are standard for any program classified as \"IDE\". Given that there are may IDE's around and that they all pretty much do the same thing and have very similar interfaces, I'm sure that the functionality alone cannot be copyrightable. I love the way Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE looks and feels. I'm referring to Visual Studio Desktop (not Visual Studio Code). I would like my program to look and feel the same, if not identically, at least very close. My program would have nothing in common with Microsoft's product except for how it visually looks. To be more precise, I'm interested in knowing if copying any of the following is permitted by copyright law : Program layout : where various \"sub panels or plugins or widgets\" are positioned on screen. Colors : specific shades of various colors and combinations there of, color palettes etc... Fonts, however in this case, a user might obtain a font license for personal use, and configure the program to use that specific font, but it would be nice to integrate it. Look and feel of various User Interface elements for example buttons are rectangles with text, an optional image, they have a specific width and height, a specific border size and color. Panels top bar have text on the far left, a specific fill pattern in the middle and on the right there is the \"pin\" button, and the \"close widget/panel\" button; the program editor / text editor visually highlights text with specific rectangles, and transparency patters. The question is : How far can I go in copying the user interface before it becomes copyright infringement ? I'm asking because I've seen around many programs that emulate Visual Studio's look and feel, when opening them, a normal user would struggle to tell the difference. P.S.: I assume the answer is probably no, I can't copy everything and get away with it. However, how much can be copied before it becomes copyright infringement ? Related question : Given the nature of the program I want to create, and the fact that it can be configured i.e.: its look and feel as well as graphical behavior can be changed in the settings menu; Would creating a program with a different default look and feel that can be configured manually to look exactly the same as Visual Studio be allowed (in copyright terms) ? \nTITLE: ", "output": "How far can a program's user interface be copied before it becomes copyright infringement?"}

In my layman's mind: Nobody is entitled to a \"standard of living\". Just because you lucked out to marry a high-net-worth or high-earning individual, it should not \"entitle\" you to live the good life in perpetuity after you stopped being married. This is separate from the idea that a spouse may have contributed to said high-earning status by supporting their career, which is a far valid - but a wholly separate - reason in divorce court. For example, I assume a judge can apply \"standard of living\" idea even if the wealthy spouse can show that the wealth/income didn't change upwardly during the marriage; and that the spouse didn't contribute economically at all, due to paying for hired help to do house chores, and no children resulting etc... It seems like a moral hazard, in that it encourages lower income earners to trick higher income earners into marrying them under false pretenses, just to divorce them after a couple of years for a big payout in raised standard of living, or to simply not be a good spouse since they won't suffer in the divorce. Ideally, I'm looking for an authoritative answer to \"why\", for example a reason given by a judge establishing precedent, or a politician proposing the law that passed which establishes the idea). However, a solid legal analysis would also be good. UPDATE: Just to clarify - the question isn't asking why there is spousal support/maintenance in general. It's asking very specifically, why \"established standard of living\" is the criterion used to decide the amount. In other words, if a spouse is used to a billionaire lifestyle, why is the support aimed at perpetuating that same expensive lifestyle, as opposed to being a modest livable amount (say, mode or median or average wage). \nTITLE: ", "output": "Why is \"standard of living\" a consideration in divorce asset division?"}

Users are able to create public profiles for their accounts, a nickname, real name, location, etc - but this is not essential (sometimes people put fake information, but a considerable number of people put legitimate information). Via OpenID, users are able to authenticate and identify themselves to various other websites. Some games, for example Dota 2 (published by Valve, who also run the Steam network) use publicly visible Steam IDs of players as unique identifiers within their games - in order to track information about their users, including reports, statistics, etc. Provided that a user consents, part of their data from matches they play in is exposed via an API. This includes stuff like what character you played, your performance in game, etc. This allows 3rd party websites to show you interesting statistics about the games you play. There is another API (also run by Valve) which allows users to download \"replays\" of the matches, so users can rewatch what happened. Within these replays are, regardless of what a user's consent status may be, users' uniquely identifiable Steam IDs. This allows 3rd parties to track users even if they've not opted into 3rd party sharing. My questions are: Is a Steam ID \"personal data\"?

It seems that the next step is to obtain a Business License in the city you are living in. But I can't tell if that's actually necessary, since the cloud is inherently everywhere. For example: If you are planning on starting a business located in the City of Foo or conducting business within the City's limits, you must first complete a business license application. This makes sense if you have a storefront or building where customers come within the city. But I am not sure about if you have an internet business. Since internet businesses are potentially mobile, the idea of \"doing business\" is unclear. The actual doing of business, where a transaction occurs (i.e. a customer buys something) likely occurs in the cloud, in some remote Amazon server perhaps. You might do some administrative work at a coffee shop here or there, etc. So I'm wondering if you need to obtain a city business tax license at all, or if so, in which cities the license must be obtained. I don't imagine you would need a license in every city you would sell to, as that would be a lot of work. At the same time, you could be a traveling entrepreneur living in a motor home traveling all across the states. Wondering if in that case, too, you would need to register in each city.

Has a subscription service for digital products in the cloud. Does research. Business A does 1, 2, and 3. Business B does only 2 and 3. Business C does only 4.

It seems that before 2010, South Korean dual citizenship was impossible, so if one were born before 2010 and had ethnically Korean parents who were both American citizens at the time of their birth, that child wouldn't have any chance of automatically being a South Korean citizen? Is it still true that one would have to rescind their South Korean nationality before the age of 18, and one is unable to do so later? Does visiting Korea for a short period of time (I've heard 30 days) eliminate the risk of being drafted? Is there any paperwork you can fill out beforehand like you can with Israel? The relevant laws have been changing quite a bit in the past few decades apparently, so it's hard to tell what information is still true or what's outdated. Please cite reliable sources if you can. For clarification, I am not in any way Korean, so this question is just out of curiosity and/or for a friend.

The title should be legally relevant, capture key aspects of the issue, and entice readers to learn more. \nQUESTION: I recently moved to a new apartment, and cancelled the contract for my previous apartment where I had lived for several years. The contract for the old apartment had a three month notice period, so I found a replacement tenant for the landlord to avoid paying rent on both places for that time. On moving in, the new tenant found some areas needing a little work. He has contacted the landlord, who has now asked me to resolve these issues or have the cost of doing so taken from my deposit. Some of these issues are fair complaints and I'm working with the new tenant to resolve them quickly. So far so good. The problem: Some issues date from before I moved in, but the landlord is now demanding I resolve them at my own cost. When I moved in, I signed the contract (which is the standard and well-known in Germany \"Hamburger Mietvertrag f\u00fcr Wohnraum\") at the landlord's office and received the keys directly. There was no official handover appointment where the state of the apartment was inspected, and I failed to photograph or otherwise document these issues at the time. I understand that the real problem here is my failure to document these issues on moving in (it was my first time renting my own place and I was naive). I'm fortunate enough to have a good job and ultimately I'll be fine even if I do have to pay these costs. But on principle I'm obviously not keen to pay for work handling issues from before I first rented the place, and now I'm also just plain curious who actually has the burden of proof in any dispute like this. tl;dr: Where does a tenant stand if their ex-landlord deducts costs for pre-existing issues from my deposit? The contract states the apartment condition as \"renovated\" at the time of moving in. Will the tenant find they have to pay for resolving pre-existing issues because they failed to document them at the time, or can they demand the landlord prove the issues were not pre-existing? In case it's relevant, there are a few little things but the primary issue is about the paint on two walls of the living room - the walls can't be painted evenly as they are unplastered and have a very uneven texture (very porous in some places, relatively smooth in others). The landlord now expects me to pay to plaster the wall. \nTITLE: ", "output": "(Germany) Repairs at end of rental contract for pre-existing issues: who has burden of proof?"}

Country B has a copyright duration of Life + 50 years. Country A does not apply the rule of the shorter term. A work was published in Country B by an author who died 65 years ago. Let's call this the \"original work.\" An adaptation (known as \"derivative work\" in the United States) of the original work was later published in Country B since the work is in the public domain. The author of this adaptation chose to license their work with a public-domain equivalent license (perhaps CC0). My understanding of copyright is that it grants the author an exclusive right to distribute their work in whatever manner they'd like for some amount of time (determined by the copyright duration in a country). Can a person in Country A legally use the adapted work? I'm assuming no, but then does that mean that the author of the work created in Country B does not technically have all the rights to the work they created, since they have no control over whether their work can be distributed in Country A? If that is the case, then would these rights be \"granted\" to the author of the adaptation when the copyright finally expires in Country A? I am a bit confused.

The tenancy agreement was signed in Oct 2020 and there are rent arrears for the last few months. I have a guarantor agreement signed with the tenant's dad acting as the guarantor where he is liable to pay any unpaid rent. The tenancy agreement and the guarantor agreement were both signed using a popular online esignature platform, which as far as I have researched, is a perfectly legal and acceptable way to sign a contract. The guarantor has confirmed the email address to which the guarantor agreement was emailed is his own, personal account. However, the guarantor is claiming the tenant (his son) has access to his email address and signed the guarantor agreement fraudulently - presumably without his knowledge. It might be useful to know the guarantor has claimed the son has also fraudulently set up other forms of credit (e.g. payday loans) this way and the guarantor has allegedly filed a report with the police. It is unclear if the tenant still has access to the guarantor's email account. In this scenario, is the guarantor still liable to pay the unpaid rent arrears? If he successfully claims the documents were signed fraudulently, can he still be liable by means or being complicit or aware of his son's activity, not least by (presumably) seeing the emails coming through after signature over the last 10 months?

Its a free tool to find mutual friends between two or more people. I made a facebook account to promote this website on many FB groups about mutual friends. The account got blocked because i had spammed too many different FB groups. Then i made the mistake of appealing the block using the same phone number that's connected to my regular facebook account, so now they know my first and last name as well... Shortly after this F*ck-up I received the following email in the inbox of my normal email address. To Whom It May Concern: We are writing concerning your registration and use of the domain name *******onfacebook.com, which contains the famous Facebook trademark. As you undoubtedly know, Facebook is the leading online social network service. Meta Platforms, Inc. (\u201cMeta\u201d), previously Facebook, Inc., adopted the name and trademark Facebook in February 2004 and, since that time, has actively used the Facebook name and trademark in connection with its online social network service, including maintaining the web site www.facebook.com. The term Facebook is one of the most famous trademarks on the Internet. Meta owns exclusive trademark rights to the Facebook name as a result of numerous trademark registrations in the United States and internationally, as well as related common law rights. Accordingly, Meta enjoys broad trademark rights in the name Facebook. Meta has made a substantial investment in developing and providing its services. As a result of its pioneering efforts and devoting substantial effort and resources to providing only high quality services, the Facebook name and trademarks are widely known among the consuming public worldwide, and the name and trademarks embody substantial and valuable goodwill. Accordingly, we were concerned when we learned of the registration and use of ******onfacebook.com. As we hope you can appreciate, protection of its trademarks is very important to us. The registration and use of [[domain_name]] violate the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.) because it infringes and dilutes the famous Facebook trademark. Infringement occurs when a third party\u2019s use of a company\u2019s trademark (or a confusingly similar variation thereof) is likely to confuse consumers as to the affiliation, sponsorship or endorsement of the third party\u2019s services. Trademark dilution occurs when a third party\u2019s use of a variation of a company\u2019s trademark is likely to lessen the distinctiveness of the company\u2019s famous trademark. We have filed numerous proceedings before the United Nation's World Intellectual Property Organization's arbitration panel in order to protect our rights, and have recovered thousands of domain names. We are concerned that registrant\u2019s unauthorized use of the Facebook name may cause confusion as to whether registrant or registrant\u2019s company\u2019s activities are authorized, endorsed or sponsored by Meta when, in fact, they are not. We understand that you may have registered *********onfacebook.com without full knowledge of the law in this area. However, we are concerned about your use of the Facebook trademark in the domain name. As you may know, the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act provides for serious penalties (up to $100,000 per domain name) against persons who, without authorization, use, sell, or offer for sale a domain name that infringes another\u2019s trademark. While Meta respects your right of expression and desire to conduct business on the Internet, Meta must enforce its own rights in order to protect its valuable and famous trademark. For these reasons, and to avoid consumer confusion, Meta must insist that you immediately stop using ********onfacebook.com and disable any site available at that address. You should not sell, offer to sell, or transfer the domain name to a third party and should let the domain registration expire. The domain name, *******onfacebook.com, is currently resolving to a parked page, pay-per-click advertising, sponsored links or other unauthorized use. Please disable the servers so they do not connect to a page with content. Please confirm in writing that you will agree to resolve this matter as requested.

There is a disclaimer on the website that says that the trademark is used nominatively only. Just as the website www.twittervideodownloader.com is using the trademark Twitter nominatively as well. That website is still up, so what's wrong with mine? I used the answer from this lawexchange post to create the disclaimer. The subject of the email i received is Privacy Forward - [from:enf.facebook.1******@ad-facebook.com] *******onfacebook.com - Notice of Facebook Trademark Infringement. The email originates from ***********@identity-protect.org. What should i do? Do they really have something on me? They're saying i'm violating the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.) because i'm diluting the trademark Facebook. But how am i diluting their trademark? The site hosts nothing more but a free tool. They are also saying that *The domain name, ********onfacebook.com, is currently resolving to a parked page, pay-per-click advertising, sponsored links or other unauthorized use.. This is again not true. It resolves to an angular app for determining mutual friends between two or more facebook users online. It currently does not show any advertisements either. The content also looks like a standard template because they forgot to replace [[domain_name]] in the phrase The registration and use of [[domain_name]] with the url https://*****onfacebook.com . It could very well be that they didn't even bother to read my disclaimer. What should i do? Do they really have legitimate grounds to sue me? I must add that i reside in the Netherlands so the website https://*********onfacebook.com is not subject to US law. Can they file a case against me even when there is no ground to do so at all? \nTITLE: ", "output": "I just got a facebook trademark infringement notice by email from Meta"}

In my personal opinion this looks like an outright violation of freedom of speech, because I can't think of any reason why a defendant should be in any way restricted as to what he is allowed to say. Being allowed to say anything doesn't force anyone (judge/juror) to believe that it's true and obviously there're good reasons for example to force witnesses to only say the truth, because their freedom of speech quickly conflicts with the defendant's right for a fair trial should they be allowed to lie.

One of my previous employers X (from 4 years ago) sells a similar application. (You can see where this is going.) X is now alleging that I might have stolen the code and created my own version but that is truly not the case: Every line of code has been written from scratch, and is entirely different from that of X. X is also alleging trade secret violation (without even looking at the software) but everything this software does is based on public domain knowledge. Managing patients, Exams, Bills, etc. are all public knowledge. Specific tests that go in each exam have been made based on material read from books that I can prove. My software simply provides a different way of managing practice that has not borrowed anything from X's software. I did sign a confidentiality agreement with X. But my system employs a non-secret process, and every feature in my system is based on knowledge generally available to all. The agreement also has a non-compete that states I cannot work for a competitor while I am employed with X. The agreement was signed in year 2001 in Oregon. I am now in Canada and my company is registered in Canada, trying to sell software in United States. Anyone has experience going through a similar scenario who can help me prepare a good reply? This is essentially what the letter from X says: X has recently learned that you are marketing a software product competitive with X\u2019s software product which incorporates concepts, ideas, layouts, and designs from X\u2019s software product. Similarities between your product and X\u2019s product suggest that you have misappropriated confidential information from X, including software source code, as well as failed to return all confidential information to X upon your termination.

Moreover, you are hereby notified that under your Confidentiality Agreement, you are prohibited from using or disclosing confidential information obtained and retained from X.

A little background: The basic idea is for people being given the possibility to \"insure\" another users private property, whatever that may be in any specific case. The insurer would then have the opportunity to claim profits on a timely schedule, while the insured could claim the collateral provided by the insurer, if the requirements both parties agreed upon were to be met. The insurance contracts themselves would be initialized, maintained and eventually resolved through a series of transparent open sourced smart contracts. Smart contracts are essentially little programs, that run on the blockchain. The can be reviewed by anyone interested. Questions: Is it legally necessary to formally record such a relation between two (or more) private persons? With the crypto space currently being so very unregulated, are there even laws applicable to this matter? How difficult would it be for users of such a service to declare the income generated through anything related to the platform? Would this be regarded as a form of self-employment, would they have to register a company or any of the likes? Would the platform itself, being the service provider, have to be registered in any way? The main aim of the platform would of course be income generation. Legal accountability: Would we need to explicitly declare a disclaimer to prevent being sued if a user considers the rejection of their claim unjust? Since this is a peer-to-peer system, the platform itself will mostly be uninvolved in the decision process. Instead this will be the duty of an independant third party comprised of individual users. Could the platform be held accountable in case of lost user funds? Only if the platform were at fault? (as in, did the platform's source code cause the issue?) Can a strictly blockchain based platform even be sued? Only if it is legally registered? Is there an exact legal counterpart as to the role the platform would assume in this system? It provides the framework upon wich the insurance policies are designed, contracts are established and payouts are issued. It does not directly take part in insurance business.

Any grand jury, without prodding from the prosecutor, can call witnesses and demand evidence and demand this case be prosecuted...without the prosecutor's help.\" Dennis Kearney, a former assistant prosecutor in Essex County who's now a partner in the criminal defense firm of Day Pitney, said such a move, while technically possible, would be unprecedented, and \"very unlikely\" to happen. \"The idea that a grand jury would 'go rogue'?\" asked Kearney. \"I've never seen it, and I go before grand juries for a living.\" The phrase \"demand this case be prosecuted\" is rather ambiguous, and I'm not sure whether they mean that the jury could air Christie's dirty laundry in public until the prosecutor agreed to formally ask for an indictment, or that the jury could actually perform the indictment on its own. Do grand juries have the power to indict people all by themselves, or does the prosecutor have to initiate the process?

I have been paying my accountant for helping with my corporate taxes for the last 4 years in Toronto. I was paying for the corporate taxes about 30-40% higher above the average for the same work my colleagues are paying. In return, this firm has offered to file my personal taxes for free. Which did successfully happen three times previously. It was a gentlemen's agreement and I have no proof of this agreement in writing. At the same time, he naturally never invoiced me for this work either. Question This accountant has suddenly sent me an email saying I never paid for filing my personal taxes with him for the last 4 years. The invoice is asking to pay $350-600 + HST per filing. For myself + my wife. Our taxes were really simple with simple T4 forms, nothing fancy. In fact, I used to use TurboTax and it took me 30-50 minutes to file on my own. So the invoice total is about $1600+ for four previous years of personal taxes for myself and my wife. Can I legally ignore these invoices? It does not make any sense that he sends me invoices for work done 4 years ago.

It is an opinion on the employer's proposed policy \"to impose a fine on its exempt employees who damage equipment they use in performing their jobs, such as cellular telephones and laptop computers.\" The opinion is pretty unequivocal that this is not permissible (emphasis added): [A]ny employer policy that requires deductions from the salaries of its exempt employees to pay for the cost of lost or damaged tools or equipment issued to them would violate the salary basis requirement, thereby necessitating an evaluation under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.603 to determine the effect of the improper deduction. It would not matter whether an employer implements such a policy by making periodic deductions from employee salaries, or by requiring employees to make out-of-pocket reimbursements from compensation already received. Either approach would result in employees not receiving their predetermined salaries when due on a \u201cguaranteed\u201d basis or \u201cfree and clear\u201d and would produce impermissible reductions in compensation because of the quality of the work performed under the terms of the employer\u2019s policies, contrary to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.602(a). (It also notes that such policies may be impermissible for non-exempt employees, if the deduction would drop pay below minimum wage or overtime floors.) However, it seems that employers are still instituting policies such as these. For example, in a question from 2015 on The Workplace.SE the asker (from Utah) states that they had just been required to sign a new contract: The contract states, among other things, that if the employee loses their key, they will have to pay the whole cost of re-keying each door which the lost key worked on. The cost per door is estimated at $100. This kind of deduction for lost property seems to be exactly the kind forbidden in the WHD opinion, but none of the answers to that question mention it or state that the policy is legally problematic\u2014the accepted answer specifically states that the policy is legal. So I'm wondering whether the opinion is not actually binding (other than, presumably, on the employer to whom the letter was originally directed), or if it is not applicable in this specific type of case for some reason (assuming that the OP was salaried). Or, of course, if it is \"the law\" but just not well known. On the second possibility, if Utah law explicitly allowed for this kind of deduction, would that trump the federal regulation? I know that minimum wage laws are generally interpreted in the employee's favor when there is a state/federal difference, but is that true for this kind of employment regulation? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Is this opinion by the Wage & Hour Division, disallowing fines/salary deductions for lost & damaged property, generally applicable to US employers?"}

So, the current answer states that the 4th amendment applies to traffic stops, which makes sense to me. So after thinking about that and looking up some odd articles that arguably make sense, I'm kinda curious of one of the issues that can arise from that. Question: During a legal traffic stop, let's say that when they ask for licence and registration, you ask can these documents be used against me in the court of law. It seems the answer would have to be yes Since they can and if you were to receive a ticket, they would be a part of the evidence. Assuming you give them your identification information since you are being detained and investigated, how can an officer handle such issue of not violating the 4th Amendment? Issuing a ticket for failure to have insurance would seem to have no basis since there is no proof, and requiring the proof would require either a warrant or the person to give up their right? This is a theoretical question about individuals and their rights and I do have full insurance and produce it every time. I'm not looking for answers that involve the driver to forfeit their rights (i.e. \"I would just hand it over\", \"issue the ticket, and let the courts hash it out\", etc). I think we can make a safe assumption that the person is a reasonable person that likes to preserve their rights. And again, this is from the perspective of a honest police officer that would like to keep the person's rights intact.

The data on race were derived from answers to the question on race that was asked of individuals in the United States. The Census Bureau collects racial data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d and \u201cWhite.\u201d People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race. OMB requires five minimum categories: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Reasons for Collecting Information on Race Information on race is required for many Federal programs and is critical in making policy decisions, particularly for civil rights. States use these data to meet legislative redistricting principles. Race data also are used to promote equal employment opportunities and to assess racial disparities in health and environmental risks. Race and Ethnicity Research The Census Bureau has a long history of conducting research to improve questions and data on race and ethnicity. Since the 1970s, the Census Bureau has conducted content tests to research and improve the design and function of different questions, including questions on race and ethnicity. For the latest information on Race and Ethnicity Research visit: Research to Improve Data on Race and Ethnicity Learn more about Census Bureau's ongoing history of conducting research to improve questions and data on race and ethnicity. Since the term race is supposedly based on \"social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically\" and \"race\" is not defined within the Census Bureau documents we can utilize the American Anthropological Association Statement on Race for guidance as to exactly what the construct of \"race\" is How people have been accepted and treated within the context of a given society or culture has a direct impact on how they perform in that society. The \"racial\" worldview was invented to assign some groups to perpetual low status, while others were permitted access to privilege, power, and wealth. The tragedy in the United States has been that the policies and practices stemming from this worldview succeeded all too well in constructing unequal populations among Europeans, Native Americans, and peoples of African descent. Given what we know about the capacity of normal humans to achieve and function within any culture, we conclude that present-day inequalities between so-called \"racial\" groups are not consequences of their biological inheritance but products of historical and contemporary social, economic, educational, and political circumstances. However, this does not answer the question as to precisely what \"race\" is in law. Nor is \"race\" defined in Guidance Regarding the Use of Race by Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, although the subject matter is purportedly \"Race\".

According to the FTC (though not in these words), an advertisement delivered through a trusted medium, such as the words of a celebrity or the side of an email client, has financial incentive to exaggerate the effectiveness of the product. Therefore, ads can mislead the public by using the trust in the medium to present the biased claims as truth, if it is not made clear that the information was sponsored and therefore may not be entirely unbiased. Obviously, if a blogger publishes a blog post stating that he or she used a given product and lost X amount of weight in Y amount of time, and this blogger received compensation from the maker of the product for this blog post, it would be misleading not to disclose that this was a paid advertisement. However, what about ads that make no claims whatsoever? If a Coca Cola employee were to spray paint the Coke logo onto a telephone booth, this could encourage people nearby to drink more Coke, but there was no disputable claim made. Not only that, but a similar situation could happen organically as well, if say a supermarket marked its beverage aisle with the Coke logo. There's no claim, no possible source of exaggeration, simply an image, and the assumption that it will increase sales. Does this logo on the telephone booth then need a disclaimer? The same logic could be extended to the giant advertisements in Times Square in NYC, which often do not feature claims, just branding. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Do claimless advertisements need to have disclaimers?"}

Binary options are regulated in the United States by the CFTC and gambling is regulated by each U.S. state individually. Some U. S. state have allowed pari-mutuel betting while a few have not, and some other states allow online gambling. [Ref 1] Example from my understanding: Binary Option: Is Facebook trading over $ 300 on 30. January 2022 appears to be a binary option regulated by the CFTC. Gambling: Will Donald Trump be the next U. S. president? Appears to be regulated by the local gambling authority. Polygon.com, a prediction market for YES and NO questions has been fined by the CFTC by $1.4m on the 4th January 2022. They announced, they have to removed some markets, and continued to operate until now although a fine has been spoken out by the CFTC. This is basically the part, which I don't understand. It appears the question decides the type of regulation. The type of regulation makes a fair difference. While a banking license requires million of assets a gambling license can be obtained for fairly low amounts. As part of the settlement deal, Polymarket has agreed to pay a $1.4 million civil monetary penalty and to wind down all markets displayed on Polymarket.com that do not comply with the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and applicable CFTC regulations. [Ref 2] Summa summarum, does it mean that if a company creates a question (Yes/No) on financial assets (like an option traded on an exchange) will be considered as a binary option regulated by the CFTC while a non-related financial question is considered as gambling?

Since USA has no extradition treaty with Taiwan (though USA has many more extradition treaties than Hong Kong has), could a USA resident do the same thing without penalty?

If that bothers you, move on now. In the 2016 film Arrival, humanity confronts a crisis with the arrival of a dozen alien spaceships. The US military brings linguist Louise Banks out to the one in Wisconsin, where she leads a team at a nearby temporary military installation and figures out how to communicate with the aliens. Near the end of the film, higher-ups in the military decide to close and evacuate the installation. As they are preparing to close the communication links, a soldier notices that his superior's phone is being used for a satellite call to China, presumably a call to the site of another alien ship there. After a brief search, Louise is found to be the one making the call, and confronted in a small space that used to serve as the decontamination chamber, along with lead scientist Ian Donnelly who tries to get her a few more seconds for the call. The supervisor and two armed guards are pointing guns at the pair. The supervisor asserts that the call is treason, and that if she doesn't drop it now they will shoot. Just before shots are actually fired, she finishes the call and surrenders. Neither of the two had firearms nor did either pose an immediate physical threat to the others on the base, though the superior was clearly concerned about what the full consequences of that call could be. Had either or both of them been shot dead, would the killing have been ruled justified after the fact? If not, what if any consequences would likely apply to the shooter(s)? Note: I am not sure if military or civilian law would apply, but even if the correct answer is military law, it'd be nice to know the equivalent answer if these characters were facing civil authorities (e.g., local law enforcement), as could be the consequence for e.g., unauthorized international cooperation in the face of an epidemic or similar crisis.

So I setup booby-traps that are designed to either: A. Destroy any evidence I think they might look for, or, more extremely, B. Destroy the property and anyone on it in the event that it is raided. We know from here and here that I owe trespassers some duty of care. Being an (otherwise) law-abiding citizen, I post explicit warnings within the perimeter of my property, which I have secured against trespass by anybody but a very determined attacker. I.e., the only way the police could see the warnings is if they have entered for a raid, at which point the warnings state, \"If you go any further into this property you will trigger devices that will destroy the property and kill all persons therein.\" Sure enough, the police get a no-knock search warrant, breach the outer perimeter, and stop at the warnings. At this point can I be compelled by a court to grant safe access for law enforcement to carry out the search warrant? And if, despite the clear warning, the police decide to press on with their search and an officer is injured or killed, can I be held criminally or civilly liable for that casualty? Notes & clarifications from comments: I'm revealing my mens rea in this question, but objectively I have merely secured the property and warned determined trespassers. The police can lawfully search, but do I have a duty to make my premises safe to search? Am I ex ante liable for their injuries, given the suitable warning? Or can they say, \"If you don't make it safe to search, you're liable for our injuries?\" At which point haven't they compelled me to incriminate myself, meaning that I can disarm the traps but all the premises' contents are then \"poisoned\" evidence? Practically speaking it's not hard to rig thermite to destroy evidence without endangering anyone not in close proximity. But then, destruction of evidence is a crime, and I'd rather not destroy my valuable stash of whatever. Or, again, maybe I don't have anything to hide but on principle I really don't want police in my house. So part of the motivation here is to determine: can one construct a scenario that would flat-out deter the search? One analogy that might illuminate this is to consider a hazmat factory: It is secured, it has warnings, and if police barge in and start tossing things without adequate protection they could be injured or killed. So in real life \u2013 even just approaching suspected meth labs \u2013 the police bring in hazmat specialists. They don't say, \"Please render your lab safe for us to search,\" and I don't think they say, \"We got hurt raiding your lab, so that's on you.\" In this hypothetical there is no specialist they can call because the exact threat is unknown, and designed to be unknowable in advance. In fact, I could just be bluffing and not have any boobytraps. Another reference point that occurs to me: when police are confronted with non-trivial explosive devices, whenever possible it seems they prefer to just clear a safety perimeter and destroy the device than to try to approach and disarm it. One last point of reference I came across: There is one such example in existence in the U.S.: Fugitive John Joe Gray has kept police from entering his property to arrest him for 16 years, simply because no sheriff has considered it worth the risk. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Can I booby-trap my property against police?"}

I no longer have anything with the address on it, all I know is the address itself. I bought a house, and then a few years later walked away from it because the roof was falling apart. Got married, had kids, sick child medical bills piled up and we had to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The house ended up selling at a tax deed sale. Even after the bankruptcy, my name was still attached to the property. A lawsuit to quiet the title of that property was served to me last year I believe, which I let lapse because I didn't want to deal with the house at all. After the court response quieting the title, I start getting letters from a bunch of companies stating they found money that belonged to me, and that the would offer me $X for them to get it for me. I believe I was noticed of a refund of the difference. The form DFS-UP-106 states, to claim the funds, that I have to submit my driver's license and some proof, like correspondence or a bill, that contains my name and the address on the form. First off, is this legal? I would like the unclaimed funds if I can claim them legally; If it is, while I don't have a document showing my name and the P.O. box it came from, but these people that contacted me by mail seem to have a way to do it, so how could I find some proof of me leasing/renting that PO Box? I'm going to to try calling or visiting that branch to see if they have records, but if that doesn't work, what course of action should I take?

Then someone comes along and days no that's not correct and gives a perhaps somewhat contrived legal theory as justification for why what most would want to be so actually maybe is. Many read this and think \"well, that's a little contrived, and I doubt it would be upheld, but there's a chance it is and I would have never thought of that way of looking at it. Anyway that's probably the best argument that could be made against this objectionable outcome if there was any that could possibly work.\" Bob theft brings forth an action on his theory to court and the respondent's counsel is at a loss for how to defend this claim.

Above all, he loves practice shooting with his shotgun, which he jokingly nicknamed shotzooka. One summer, Billy decides to innovate. He spends his days adding new features to his shotzooka. First, he adds a telescope. Then he adds a laser sight. But does not stop there. Somehow he manages to attach a remotely controlled anti-tank guided missile to his beloved gun. The now upgraded shotzooka is capable of immense destructive power. Strangely enough, though, the weapon still resembles a regular shotgun. Billy decides to test his weapon's new capabilities on a tree. He locks his target, then takes a 180 degree turn and pulls the trigger. The missile turns 180 around and, flying at Mach 3 speed, pulverizes the tree to the ground. Billy had never had such power in his hands.

I declined, we want the cash. They refuse. What more can I do? Longer story: Last October we flew Hamburg Majorca for vacation. We checked in for our return flight, and while at airside all flights for the airline (Air Berlin) got cancelled. No official announcements were made. Staff left desks. For multiple Majorca flights going to Germany by Air Berlin. Monitors showed the words Delayed. Some flights showed cancelled. Some flights just disappeared from the screen. Two staff appeared three hours after our flight departure and distributed a single pre-printed letter explaining our passenger rights. They had no news to update us on when our flights might fly, nor any reason why the flights were cancelled. A number of online news outlets said Air Berlin staff were on strike. Some 12 hours later a chartered plane was arranged, we flew back to Hannover and jumped on a bus that brought us to Hamburg Airport. Based on the letter Air Berlin shared with me, and based on http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm I calculated that the flight was more than 1500km and thus we should get paid 2x400euro in cash. The URL on the preprinted letter I got from Air Berlin was invalid. Eventually I found and complained, and requested they pay the 2x400euro penalty to my bank account. They apologised, then told me the penalty was optional for airlines to pay, and instead offered 2x300euro discount vouchers instead. I replied, declined the gift vouchers, reminded them of the passenger rights, and again requested payment to my bank account. The replied that the flight was cancelled due to inbound flight being struck by lightening - thus they need not pay me anything at all.

I am working on a number of different projects within the company but spend 80+% of my time on one particular project. This project is an agile project where we develop closely with the customer who is participating in it. Work is done more or less by acclamation, although we have a somewhat rough plan. However, I always enforce that all work done is tracked using Youtrack so that we can agree on estimates, do moderations and that the customer can verify work that we marked as fixed and all this works well. All the work is also based separate specifications that we or they draft in the first place, then agree on and derive features and tasks from it. So far so good. Now however we're at a situation where the customer is a single person and therefore has to take the roles of the product owner as well as the project manager, as the customer only booked/pays for development time (they book a budget of hours and my company can \"throw work\" at this and since a couple of months it's only me). The problem is that the customer only knows what they want not how to achieve it. In other words, no customer has no appropriate technical background to be in the role of the product owner. So the development process works in a way that the developers (mostly me) make suggestions on how to approach new features technically and the customer agrees so that we can move forward. The customer, due to their lack of technical knowledge, virtually cannot disagree mostly. Sometimes they have their own ideas that we discuss but the work that we start is always agreed on and all arguments and concerns have been voiced; all future implications (complexity, needed time etc.) were also voiced. So recently we finished integrating a huge component into the project, according to the tasks. However, this component is highly complex and does not align with their former component as they had envisioned. The customer even called it a nightmare, as it costed already much more time than planned and during our daily scrum I hinted that, should we continue the integration, it will cost much more time and increase the complexity even further. Now to get to the point of my question: Do I as a developer in my current position have any additional legal liabilities should this project fail or should the customer claim for recourse? With additional I mean other liabilities that are not covered through the company I am working for. I should note that I made the CEO already aware of this project and that it might back-fire. We also agreed that there has been at least one other red flag regarding this project. What should I do? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Legal liability of a developer employed by a company"}

Does this constitute personal data processing? If so, do I have to register as a \"Data Protection Officer\"? Also, is any website able to comply with GDPR, seeing that any webpage visit triggers the processing and response of an IP address? There is an exception \"for journalistic purposes or the purpose of academic artistic or literary expression\" (Article 85 in the GDPR). However this relies on the member states' law. Edit: Also, there is an exception for personal activity: Article 2, paragraph 2.

The friends worked on the app for roughly a year however the idea guy started getting more and more angry about the project taking too long to finish. Eventually he started threatening us to shut down the project if we don't work faster and tried to replace members. We refused and he eventually 'stopped' the project by removing access to all servers and cancelled paid accounts to Github and Co (most of them were held by shared accounts where he wasn't even the one paying them) Now, the 4 of us are not happy about this at all since we worked for 1 year almost every day on this thing and in our opinion this 1 guy does have no right to decide whether the project is dead or not so we want to finish it without him: Put together some money, re-purchase servers and so on. The idea guy incorporated a real company on paper but none of us signed anything, nor did he pay any of us. There are also no patents or anything like that. (When we asked him a few times to finally get the paperwork done he always avoided the question which seemed to be like he never really intended of sharing anything with us from the beginning.)

{"input": "Generate a concise, engaging title for the following legal question on an internet forum. The title should be legally relevant, capture key aspects of the issue, and entice readers to learn more. \nQUESTION: Some US states such as California and New York go to great lengths to keep former residents part of their tax base. As an example, New York continues to consider an individual to be domiciled in NY until and unless that individual establishes a permanent domicile elsewhere. And (with few exceptions) if New York considers you to be domiciled in NY, you are considered a resident and must pay state tax on your worldwide income. This is distinct from individuals who have to pay state tax on NY source income. Bottom line: if New York considers you a resident, you must pay state taxes on worldwide income, even if you did not set foot in NY or in any way have a connection to NY during the tax year. Example: John Q. Smith lives in NY and pays taxes for five years. For all of 2015 he is outside of NY and couch surfs around the US without establishing a permanent domicile. He does not return to NY after 2015. New York considers him to still be domiciled in NY for 2015 and therefore he must pay NY state tax on all of his worldwide income for 2015. Smith objects and faces off with New York in court. The first question would be what court(s) would have jurisdiction. New York would love it to be heard in state court and just cite their state tax law as their authority to tax Smith. And Smith wants it to be heard in federal court, but can't sue the state due to the Eleventh Amendment. So is that it, end of ballgame for Smith? The case is heard in NY, New York state law is the authority cited, Smith gets a state judgement against him and he has no way to appeal it outside of the state's jurisdiction? And the second question, assuming somehow the case gets to federal court or another state's court: Smith argues he had no connection to New York during 2015 and shouldn't have to pay New York state taxes. New York state counters his argument with: \"We have the authority to tax John Q. Smith under the legal theory __________________________\". What would that legal theory be? Has this been tested in court? Please do not give practical answers or workarounds that would short-circuit the process before they get to court. This is a hypothetical question on legal theory, not an actual case I'm trying to resolve. \nTITLE: ", "output": "What authority does a US state use to tax former residents?"}

The performance grade also has a direct link to salary increases and bonus. The voluntary work is with children, and although I have children myself I do not feel comfortable in a school setting.

The title should be legally relevant, capture key aspects of the issue, and entice readers to learn more. \nQUESTION: Hypothetical case for U.S. law (close to reality but simplified here): A company offers advertising. Customers may get paid by publishing the advertising. The customers presumably want to do this in order to make profits. Some customers may be organized as nonprofit and they're not allowed to make profits, but individuals are not nonprofit and nonprofit organizations presumably want to do this in order to make surpluses. The company does not appear to serve primarily nonprofits. The company requires a contract, which is a contract of adhesion. Ignore that the contract may have been sloppily drafted. Assume the company will defend it as written now. The contract forbids customers from doing anything \"commercial\". The contract does not explicitly define \"commercial\" but implicitly relies on one or more legal definitions inferrable from outside of the contract. While it is possible for a customer to enter into the contract and then do nothing so as not to do anything \"commercial\", the customer would then earn no revenue and therefore no profit or surplus, and such a possibility is therefore a trivial case not considered here. Therefore, while the company is not in violation of the contract, all customers, except nonprofits, are always in violation. The only cure is to cease doing anything with the company. If I, an individual, enter into the contract and I then do something \"commercial\" in relation to the company, is the company barred from treating me as violating the contract because what I do under the contract is \"commercial\" when what everyone is doing under the contract is \"commercial\"? For example, might the bar be due to estoppel? Companies are usually presumed to legally exist in perpetuity, so assume perpetuity for this company. Does it add fuel to the legal fire if enforcing the bar to commercialism against all customers would put the company out of business? In this case, customers would not publish the advertising supplied by the company, no one in the world would act on the advertisements, advertisers would stop advertising through this company, the company would stop receiving any revenue, and the company therefore would have no more profit. Indeed, the company could not pay any obligations still outstanding, and that would force it into bankruptcy. Does that mean the company cannot enforce contractual violations grounded solely on commercialism? \nTITLE: ", "output": "if all customers always violate a contract, is enforcement legally impossible?"}

The guy who owned it was generally friendly, and when we discussed what would happen after the lease ends he said it would go month to month and I'd need to give him 60 days notice when I was ready to move out. The building was recently bought by a company. I have not signed anything with that company, and they have owned the building for about 3 months. I told them today (August 2nd) that I intended to vacate at the end of 60 days. They told me that since I told them in August (not July 31st) I would be required to pay rent for September and October instead of just 60 days. Here is what the lease says: Holdover by Lessee. Should Lessee remain in possession of the demised premises with the consent of the Lessor after the natural expiration of this lease, a new month-to-month tenancy shall be created between Lessor and Lessee, which shall be subject to all the terms and conditions hereof but shall be terminated on 58 days' or two rental periods, written notice served by either Lessor or Lessee on the other party. What does the 58 days' or two rental periods mean? Do I get to choose? Do they get to choose? Can I terminate my September 30th (58 or 59 days) and avoid paying for rent in October assuming I served written notice to them tomorrow? Why would it say \"58 days or two rentals periods\"? To make things more confusing, there is this statute in Minnesota: (Emphasis mine) 504B.145 RESTRICTION ON AUTOMATIC RENEWALS OF LEASES. Notwithstanding the provisions of any residential lease, in order to enforce any automatic renewal clause of a lease of an original term of two months or more which states, in effect, that the term shall be deemed renewed for a specified additional period of time of two months or more unless the tenant gives notice to the landlord of an intention to quit the premises at the expiration of the term due to expire, the landlord must give notice to the tenant as provided in this section. The notice must be in writing and direct the tenant's attention to the automatic renewal provision of the lease. The notice must be served personally or mailed by certified mail at least 15 days, but not more than 30 days prior to the time that the tenant is required to furnish notice of an intention to quit.

The basis for this question is that there's a bit of debate upon whether impeachment itself is a legal process or a political one. The criteria by which a president is impeached is deliberately vague, but the penalties for a successful impeachment are partially legal and partially political (i.e. removed from office, barred from serving again; but this does not otherwise deprive the defendant of their liberty (though other legal charges may)). Regardless, because impeachment does not have any stated criteria other than, \"Treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,\" those penalties could theoretically come about simply by virtue of Congress holding a 2/3 majority of an opposing party.

Now, normally any use of force by a state is subject to international humanitarian law (IHL \u2013 the laws of war). However, since the Security Council can authorize specific uses of force and not just blanket statements such as \"force can be used,\" the question arises as to whether or not it can override IHL. In theory, it would seem a little strange, particularly if we decide IHL counts as Jus Cogens (a peremptory norm of international law), but the charter explicitly states that Security Council decisions are binding on any state that is a member of the United Nations, and that any obligations a state has arising from the charter supersede other obligations under international law. So, to make up a case for clarity, say the UNSC were to pass a resolution saying that because of the power of the Islamic State in Syria, not only is it legal for states to use force against them, but they no longer have to worry about killing civilians, since only by killing large numbers of people will the world be able to deter the terrorists.

Co. v. Stout, 84 U.S. 657. As I understand it, In general, if a person is injured while trespassing on someone\u2019s property then, unless the injury is due to some specific fault of the landowner, the landowner isn\u2019t liable. After all, if someone trespasses on your property, you shouldn\u2019t be liable for poor judgment exercised by the trespasser, especially since he shouldn\u2019t have been trespassing in the first place. But Stout created an exception to this, initially termed the \u201cturntable doctrine\u201d (named after the piece of railroad machinery that that the child Stout was playing on when injured). The idea was that young children are a special case requiring a higher duty of care. Stout was cited soon after in a similar turntable case, Keffe v. Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad Co., 21 Minn. 207 (1875). The term \u201cattractive nuisance doctrine\u201d originated in Keffe, which explained the attractiveness concept thus: To treat the plaintiff as a voluntary trespasser is to ignore the averments of the complaint, that the turn-table, which was situate[d] in a public (by which we understand an open, frequented) place, was, when left unfastened, very attractive, and, when put in motion by them, was dangerous to young children, by whom it could be easily put in motion, and many of whom were in the habit of going upon it to play. The turn-table, being thus attractive, presented to the natural instincts of young children a strong temptation; and such children, following, as they must be expected to follow, those natural instincts, were thus allured into a danger whose nature and extent they, being without judgment or discretion, could neither apprehend nor appreciate, and against which they could not protect themselves. The difference between the plaintiff's position and that of a voluntary trespasser, capable of using care, consists in this, that the plaintiff was induced to come upon the defendant's turn-table by the defendant's own conduct, and that, as to him, the turntable was a hidden danger, a trap. Twenty years later, the New York Court of Appeals discussed the turntable doctrine in Walsh v. F.R.R. Co., 39 N.E. 1068 (NY 1895) and said Stout didn't apply in that case. Maybe I'm reading Walsh wrong, but it seems to me to be saying that Stout might apply in some cases, but it doesn't in that specific case. But then Morse v. Buffalo Tank Corp., 19 N.E.2d 981, 280 N.Y. comes along in 1939 and says The general rule which has prevailed since the well-known turntable case (Walsh v. Fitchburg R.R. Co., 145 N.Y. 301) is that the so-called doctrine of attractive nuisance does not apply in New York, and that the only duty which an owner of land owes to a trespasser or bare licensee is to abstain from affirmative acts of negligence or not to injure intentionally such person. And from there to the present, supposedly New York doesn't follow the Attractive Nuisance Doctrine. How can Morse make that flying leap, from Stout not being applicable in the particular case (Morse), to saying that \"the so-called doctrine of attractive nuisance does not apply in New York\"? (Reason for question: I am taking a paralegal class and one of the exercises asks the student to determine whether the attractive nuisance doctrine holds in the state where the student lives.) This question is different. I made the mistake of writing two questions in one post, only one of which was answered. I have split them up into two separate questions. I copied the background material from one to the other so people wouldn't need to click over to the other question to understand this one. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Flying leap from Walsh to Morse"}

As far as I can tell, the mashup itself is not copyrighted. If I want to use a mashup song like this one (contains copyrighted music, mashup itself is not copyrighted), is it legal to use a Youtube audio downloader site or similar to obtain an MP3 file of it? My guess is no as it contains copyrighted music the video author doesn't (appear to) have rights to redistribute. If that's the case, would it be different if I have purchased all the songs included? So in the above example, if I have purchased a legal copy of both Pompeii and Viva la Vida, does this change things?

(Actually, that may be too strong an assertion: as best I can tell these often-called Miranda rights appear only to apply when law enforcement wishes to ensure that statements from a subject in custody be admissible in a criminal trial against the subject.) Recently the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez that not being allowed counsel of one's choice was grounds for automatic reversal of a conviction. The Right to Counsel seems well-defined for trial, but not for arrest and investigation. Therefore: Regarding the arrest and/or custodial interrogation stage: Are there any laws that govern who can serve as counsel, and how one must be allowed to contact them? For example, if I am arrested and: I want use a friend who has no legal training as \"counsel,\" do the police have any legal recourse from allowing me to talk to him prior to interrogation? E.g., can they insist that my counsel be a member of the bar in the state where I have been arrested? I want to consult a \"team\" of qualified counselors. Are there legal grounds or regulations to limit the number of individuals I consult prior to interrogation, and who I have present during interrogation? Can my contact with counsel be proscribed in any way? E.g., can the police limit the duration or schedule of my contact with counsel? Can they impede or delay access to me by someone who claims to be my counsel? What do police have to do to facilitate my access to my desired counsel(s)? E.g., how long can I be held after requesting an attorney without being allowed to attempt to contact one? What means must I be granted to find and contact the counsel of my choice?

The NY based consumer is using a Windows PC that is not unusual in its hardware or configuration. My understanding is that a seller can't sell goods that they know aren't fit for their intended purpose. For example, this is in the UCC: \u00a7 2-315. Implied Warranty: Fitness for Particular Purpose. Where the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is unless excluded or modified under the next section an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose. \u00a72-316 talks about exclusions or modifications and says they must be conspicuous. For this question let's assume that the seller doesn't have any specific text regarding this in their terms of sale or in the terms of service for their online storefront. My understanding of this is that a particular good has to be able to do what goods of its type do. For example, a retailer can't sell a shovel made of metal so weak that it bends instead of digging into the ground. How does this apply to products whose purpose is to entertain? In particular I'm looking for information on video games. I have three points I'm curious about, and wondering if the retailer is violating the UCC (or any other laws) in any of these cases: Some people like some games while others dislike them. Would different people have different abilities to claim that a retailer had violated the law based on personal tastes? Some games are universally disliked. They receive nearly universally bad reviews by both consumers and professional reviewers, with very few positive reviews and nearly nobody praising the game. The game is simply not enjoyable in any way for the vast majority of people. The game simply will not run on the consumer's PC. Others are able to get it to run, but the particular consumer mentioned in the first paragraph cannot get the game to run. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Merchantability of low quality video games & UCC 2-315"}

Apologies if this is the wrong forum. I have set up my mobile app to use Google's own Consent Management Platform called User Messaging Platform / UMP (https://developers.google.com/admob/ump/android/quick-start) via Admob to gather consent to show ads. My Admob account is set to show either personalised or non-personalised ads depending on which settings users select in the consent form. The consent form shows up fine so long as users do not have personalisation disabled in their phone settings / Google account and so long as I haven't disabled personalised ads completely from within the Admob / UMP interface. In this case, users who use the form are able to disable whichever aspects of data processing they want and Google Admob automatically disables elements of ad personalisation accordingly, and completely disables all ads if users do not select the required elements in the consent form. However, if a user does have personalised ads disabled on their phone / Google settings or if I have disabled all personalised ads from within the Admob / UMP interface, then the consent form is not able to be displayed to users. In this case, users will simply see non-personalised ads in the app without having been presented with a form beforehand. There is no way at all to present a form to users because the request is always unavailable. It turns out that this is expected behaviour and exactly how the UMP consent form is apparently supposed to function. To demonstrate this, Google displays this message in the Admob interface about their consent platform messages: This is the answer that Google gave directly to this question: If you have disabled personalized ads then there is no need to display the consent form. The forms and all consent are only needed for when you are looking to show personalized ads. So to be compliant with GDPR you just need to have the ability to call the consent and if the person has the phone set to show personalized ads, it will then show them the form. With the steps that you have mentioned, the behavior looks actually to be correct, if you have chosen to not show personalized ads, then there is no need for the forms. This appears to me to be contradictory to the advice that Google themselves display on their site, which states that 'non-personalised' ads still use cookies and therefore require consent to display: https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/about/company/user-consent-policy-help/ What if I\u2019m a publisher serving only non-personalised ads to EEA and UK users? If you do not serve personalised ads to users that visit your site, and visits to your site do not influence the ads served elsewhere, you are still required to obtain consent for the use of cookies or mobile identifiers, where legally required. Consent for cookies or mobile identifiers is still required because non-personalised ads still use cookies or mobile identifiers to combat fraud and abuse, for frequency capping and for aggregated ad reporting. https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9007336?hl=en-GB Non-personalised ads (NPA) Although non-personalised ads don\u2019t use cookies or mobile ad identifiers for ad targeting, they do still use cookies or mobile ad identifiers for frequency capping, aggregated ad reporting and to combat fraud and abuse. Therefore, you must obtain consent to use cookies or mobile ad identifiers for those purposes where legally required, per the ePrivacy Directive in certain EEA countries. Therefore, I'm completely confused by this. Is this a case of Google's team not understanding their own legal obligations? Should I be wary about releasing my app using Google's UMP which I have already integrated? Or is there a technical detail that I'm not aware of which makes Google's approach GDPR compliant? For reference, here is Google's AdMob & AdSense program policies Publisher integration with the IAB TCF v2.0: https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9760862?hl=en&ref_topic=9756841 \nTITLE: ", "output": "Is Google's Consent Management Platform not GDPR compliant since it does not show a consent form when 'personalised ads' are disabled?"}

The penalty for murder, treason, and piracy was lowered to life imprisonment, so sentences in 2022 for those crimes, even if committed in the past, cannot result in a death sentence, since section 11(i) of the Charter would reduce the penalty. The same applies to various military offences whose punishments were reduced from death to life imprisonment. Sentencing in 2022 for older crimes might result in a death sentence. What are those crimes that could result in a death sentence, or are there none? No limitation There is no statute of limitations on hybrid and indictable offences, so people can be charged with hybrid and indictable offences at any time. This means an accused can be charged with and found guilty of offences committed 120 years ago. However, summary offences must be charged within 12 months after they are committed. Punishment In Canada, anyone can be charged with, convicted of, and sentenced for an offence committed in the past if it was an actual offence at the time of commission, even after expiry or repeal of the law for that offence. The offence for the charge does not need to be an offence at the time of charge, conviction, or sentencing, as long as it was an offence at the time of commission. A person can still be charged with a repealed offence as long as the offence is in existence at the time that the offence was committed. http://criminalnotebook.ca/index.php/Repealed_Offences Under Section 11(i) of the Charter, \"Any person charged with an offence has the right: if found guilty of the offence and if the punishment for the offence has been varied between the time of commission and the time of sentencing, to the benefit of the lesser punishment.\" However, if something was previously an offence, but it later became no longer an offence, then the punishment was not \"varied\" and the punishment still applies to those convicted before it stopped being an offence. For example, if X is an offence on 2000-01-01 but no longer an offence on 2000-01-02, then \"X on 2000-01-01\" is an offence subject to the penalty if convicted on 2001-01-03, but \"X on 2000-01-02\" is not an offence. The penalty immediately before the repeal would be the penalty at the time of sentencing for the purpose of section 11(i) of the Charter specifying lesser punishment, under the Interpretation Act: 43 Where an enactment is repealed in whole or in part, the repeal does not [\u2026] (d) affect any offence committed against or contravention of the provisions of the enactment so repealed, or any punishment, penalty or forfeiture incurred under the enactment so repealed, or (e) affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any right, privilege, obligation or liability referred to in paragraph (c) or in respect of any punishment, penalty or forfeiture referred to in paragraph (d), and an investigation, legal proceeding or remedy as described in paragraph (e) may be instituted, continued or enforced, and the punishment, penalty or forfeiture may be imposed as if the enactment had not been so repealed. As an example, on 2018-12-11, someone was charged with \"pretending to practise witchcraft\" under section 365(b) of the Criminal Code, even though it was repealed two days later on 2018-12-13, and conviction and sentencing were still possible when the article was published on 2018-12-19. Timmins police charged 33-year-old Tiffany Butch on Dec. 11, accusing her of demanding money in return for lifting a curse. Two days later, Section 365 of the Criminal Code \u2014 which prohibits \"pretending to practise witchcraft\" \u2014 was formally repealed. It's likely that Butch, who goes by the nickname \"White Witch of the North,\" will be the last person in Canada to be charged, and potentially tried, for the offence. Marc Depatie, a spokesperson for the Timmins force, said police and prosecutors work with the laws that are on the books at the time of the alleged offence, pointing to historical sexual offences as an example. \"That's why police and the Crown attorneys keep ancient, or aged, versions of the Criminal Code on hand, to see what laws apply,\" he said. Depatie said the fact that the offence was about to be scrubbed from the Criminal Code was not a factor in the decision to lay the charge. Elements of the case were \"best captured\" by that section of the Criminal Code in consultation with the local Crown attorney's office, he said. https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/witchcraft-criminal-code-charge-1.4951071 In these types of fraud cases, if the accused pays restitution, they would drop the charges, which is the outcome of that case when the Crown withdrew charges on 2019-03-26. However, if they pressed for charges and a conviction occurred later, a sentence would be based on the lesser of the penalty at the time of commission and time of sentencing, which would be up to imprisonment of 2 years less one day plus a fine of not more than $5,000. Even though section 365(b) would have been repealed at the time of sentencing, the punishment would still apply. The article correctly says she was \"likely\" to be the last person charged and potentially tried, since later charges under this section were possible until 2019-12-12, 12 months after a possible charge for that offence committed on 2018-12-12. In the case of a conviction for \"having sexual relations with a stepdaughter in violation of paragraph 153(1)(a) of the Criminal Code (now repealed)\" repealed at the time of sentencing (the section was also renumbered to 158, implying the offence was committed between 1970 and 1985), the court does not consider a repeal as the punishment being \"varied\" to zero: The Court of Appeal also rejected the argument of there being a section 11(i) benefit due to the punishment having been, in effect, reduced to zero by the previous offence having been repealed [\u2026] Section 11(i) does not afford the right to any \u201clesser punishment\u201d that was temporarily available in the time between the commission of the offence and sentencing for that offence. Thus, in cases where an offence was committed before a lesser punishment became available, and where sentencing occurred after that lesser punishment was eliminated, the offender would not have the benefit of the lesser punishment available in the interim period. Rather, section 11(i) provides a binary right, granting only the lesser of two punishments: that on the date of the offence and that on the date of sentencing (Poulin, supra). https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/check/art11i.html If sentencing occurs after repeal or expiry of an offence, the punishment still applies. The punishment at the time of sentencing, for the purpose of section 11(i), would be the punishment immediately before the repeal or expiry (see section 43 of Interpretation Act cited above). Abolition of death penalty offences committed later The penalty for murder, treason, and piracy was lowered to life imprisonment effective 1976-07-26, and the penalty for various military offences was lowered to life imprisonment effective 1999-09-01. Anyone convicted of these offences today would suffer life imprisonment instead of death, so these offences are no longer punishable by death, even if they were committed before 1976. In Criminal Law Amendment Act (No. 2), 1976, they also explicitly commute all death sentences for three particular offences: [(4) is omitted because it is similar to (2)] 25 (1) If, on the day this Act comes into force, any person is under a sentence of death for murder punishable by death that has not been commuted, that sentence thereupon becomes a sentence of imprisonment for life for first degree murder without eligibility for parole until he has served twenty-five years of his sentence. (2) If, after the coming into force of this Act, an appeal against conviction by a person under a sentence of death upon the coming into force of this Act for murder punishable by death is dismissed, that sentence thereupon becomes a sentence of imprisonment for life for first degree murder without eligibility for parole until he has served twenty-five years of his sentence. (3) If, on the day this Act comes into force, any person is under sentence of death for treason or piracy that has not been commuted, that sentence is deemed to have been commuted to imprisonment for life with like effect as if the commutation had been granted before the day this Act came into force. They commute death sentences only for murder, treason, and piracy, so other older offences could still be punishable by death. Death penalty not \"cruel and unusual\" The Supreme Court found that the death penalty and even mandatory death penalty are not \"cruel and unusual treatment or punishment\" under section 2(b) of the Bill of Rights (Miller et al. v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 680). However, the lesser punishment of life imprisonment without parole was recently found to be \"cruel\" punsishment (R. v. Bissonnette, 2022 SCC 23). Would this judgement have any effect on death penalty sentencing in 2022? Or would it have no effect, because life imprisonment without parole is different from death (and somehow a punishment could be \"cruel\" but lesser than a punishment that is not \"cruel\"), or because it would be retroactive? Main Question If there is some capital offence from a long time ago that is no longer an offence, without any reduction to its punishment, and someone in 2022 is convicted of committing that offence while it was still an offence, then it would be punishable by the death penalty. For example, if Y was an offence with death specified as the minimum punishment, but then it was repealed effective 1921-01-01 with death still specified as the minimum punishment when it was repealed, then someone convicted in 2022 of \"Y on 1920-12-31\" would be necessarily sentenced to death. Similarly, if an offence specified death as the maximum punishment, then someone convicted of it would be possibly sentenced to death. Do these offences exist, and if so, what are they? (even though the federal cabinet would probably commute a death sentence in 2022) It would be hypocritical for Canada to characterize itself as a country opposed to capital punishment by refusing extradition when the possibility of death penalty would \"shock the conscience\", while simutaneously subjecting those under its jurisdiction to liability of death penalty for ancient, repealed/expired offences. Is there anything preventing this, such as a lack of applicable offences? \nTITLE: ", "output": "What offences are punishable by death in Canada in 2022?"}

As part of the deal, Samsung also agreed to market Windows Phone devices and the two companies shared some patented technologies. Now Microsoft is complaining that Samsung has \"stopped complying with its agreement,\" according to a Friday announcement attributed to David Howard, Microsoft corporate vice president and deputy general counsel. The announcement of the lawsuit heavily implied that Samsung stopped complying with the 2011 contract after Microsoft announced the acquisition of rival device maker Nokia last September. Moreover, Howard contended that Samsung is resisting now because it currently makes more money from its Android-based devices than it did when it inked the deal back in 2011. Why do the manufacturers using an operating system have to pay patent royalties based on the operating system? Shouldn't Google be the one to pay, also why isn't Microsoft also suing Google? I thought it really strange and that it didn't make sense for a manufacturing company to pay for a generic operating system patent. Also, isn't there a 15 year expiry, meaning the patent should be invalid right now? It was from some years ago, so I was wondering what happened and if the patent still applies and the patent is also valid in other regions.

I simplified the math in the title; dividing prices by 1000 doesn't change factual pattern. If car = 3K if of the age repesented, then Alex got a bargain of 500 = (3 \u2013 2.5)K. Thus why would Alex get \"an award of \u00a3800 (\u00a33,000 less the \u00a32,200 value of the car received)\"? Alex wouldn't get anything! What's his \"contractual loss of bargain\"? Why give him it \"rather than returning each party to their starting positions\"? Prof Richard Taylor, Damian Taylor. Contract Law Directions (6 edn, 2019). p 189. All sections refer to Misrepresentation Act 1967. Damages in lieu of rescission Alex buys a car from Phillippa for \u00a32,500, but due to a misrepresentation about the car\u2019s age, the car is only worth \u00a32,200. If Alex rescinded, he would return to Phillippa the car worth \u00a32,200 and get his \u00a32,500 back from Phillippa. So he has his \u00a32,500 back in his hands. If the court decides to award damages in lieu of rescission under s.2(2), such damages would have to achieve the same result. Since no rescission is being ordered, Alex keeps the car worth \u00a32,200 so he needs another \u00a3300 to bring him up to the \u00a32,500 he could have got under rescission. What these damages should not cover, however, is any other items of loss, for example suppose Alex has purchased \u00a3100 of accessories which only fit models of the year he thought he was purchasing and which are now useless to him. Such losses would have been left equally uncompensated if rescission plus indemnity had been awarded and they can only be recovered if Alex establishes some other right to damages, for example under s.2(1), which is considered later. [1.] Similarly, if the car would have been worth \u00a33,000 if of the age represented, there should be no question of getting an award of \u00a3800 (\u00a33,000 less the \u00a32,200 value of the car received) since that would be to give him [2.]\u00b8his contractual loss of bargain rather than returning each party to their starting positions. To gain such loss of bargain damages, Alex would have to prove that the age of the car was a term, not just a representation and that there was therefore a breach of contract. \nTITLE: ", "output": "If you paid $2.5 for a car that's worth $3 if of the age represented, why would you get (1) an award or (2) loss of bargain damages?"}

I am quoting from: http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18 Title 18, Chapter 39, Sub-chapter B, 3922, (a), (1) Theft by Deception \u00a7 3922. Theft by deception. (a) Offense defined.--A person is guilty of theft if he intentionally obtains or withholds property of another by deception. A person deceives if he intentionally: (1) creates or reinforces a false impression, including false impressions as to law, value, intention or other state of mind; but deception as to a person's intention to perform a promise shall not be inferred from the fact alone that he did not subsequently perform the promise; Title 18, Chapter 39, Sub-chapter B, 3921, (b) Theft by unlawful taking or disposition. Immovable property. \u00a7 3921. Theft by unlawful taking or disposition. (a) Movable property.--A person is guilty of theft if he unlawfully takes, or exercises unlawful control over, movable property of another with intent to deprive him thereof. (b) Immovable property.--A person is guilty of theft if he unlawfully transfers, or exercises unlawful control over, immovable property of another or any interest therein with intent to benefit himself or another not entitled thereto. As a landlord, our property is the rental and any capitol we may gain. With tenant landlord laws as they are, the landlord is deprived of their property and ability to rent the property simply by virtue of the fact that someone now has access. Gaining access to property through (gross) deliberate deception with the express purpose of gaining access to property knowingly without the ability to pay is denying a landlord of their property and capital with intent and tantamount to Theft by Deception. The result of this is that I am unable to rent the apartment in question and am now dealing with a tenant that intends to continue the deception without paying. They did pay just enough money to get in, however, the lies and deceptions to continue with intent to deceive and retain property for personal gain. To make matters worse, this tenant did this with the previous landlord which evicted her. Before anyone says there is remedy available in court, I will remind you that this tenant, as it turns out, does not have a pot to pee in and does not have enough real property to recover damages and losses. As well, the law allows appeals and extensions making the situation worse. In otherwords, often the remedy results in court costs and fees for the landlord as well as losses that cannot be recovered. I realize that lawyers and courts are reluctant to call this fraud and theft, however, can you help an old guy understand why this specific and clear attempt to defraud and deprive a property owner of access rights to their property would not be considered illegal? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Is fraudulent activity related to renting a residence - Theft by Deception?"}

Can the owner just send a letter like this and have the violation(s) dropped: I, the owner of said vehicle, am not the driver (see attached redacted copy of driver's license) in the photo provided. I will not be held to answer for the driver. The driver and the owner are friends. This all took place in California. Both people are Californian residents. Some relevant exposition: Yet traffic cameras do not always produce probable cause that a particular person has committed a crime. To get around this \u201cproblem\u201d (as a certain law-and-order president-elect might call it), several states have created an entirely novel phylum of law: the civil violation of a criminal prohibition. Using this nifty device, a city can charge you of a crime without any witnesses, without any probable cause determination, and without any civil due process. In short, municipal officials and their private contractors have at their disposal the powers of both criminal and civil law and are excused from the due process duties of both criminal and civil law. It\u2019s a neat trick that would have made King George III blush. - Adam J.

Also, the image is a photo which appears to have been taken to document normal conditions at a particular location which appears to be more or less generally accessible to the public.

Alice contacts organization B requesting permission for use of the image. Organization B responds by saying \"That's actually not our photo; we got it from Org C.\" Org C owns the land where the photo was taken. Alice then contacts Org C, and the rights manager says \"Sorry, we've checked and that's definitely not our image. We'd generally say ask Org B instead, but recognizing the circularity, we have no further recommendations.\" What are the consequences of Alice's options? It seems like they include... Use the image, on the grounds that probably nobody will claim copyright, because the most obvious potential copyright holders expressly disclaim ownership, and an individual might be unlikely to care (and in this particular case, possibly unlikely to recognize the image as uniquely theirs). An individual photographer could also be deceased, leaving no heirs intimately familiar with the work enough to claim copyright. Alice would be willing to take the image down if requested to do so.

I am genuinely curious about it. If this question isn't appropriate here, please advise me of a better place to ask it. Here you can see the arrest of George Floyd (warning, potentially disturbing): [Link]. In the video you can see the officer lethally pinning Mr. Floyd on the ground. It seems neither of the two officers were aware that Mr. Floyd would soon die because of the pinning. Many of the bystanders were worried that Mr. Floyd was being seriously hurt, but it's hard to say if any of them knew that Mr. Floyd was in grave danger. In any case, none of the bystanders were able to interfere because either they then would be arrested, or the police might then have justifiable reason to shoot and kill them. Question: Suppose you were a bystander and you 100% knew that if the officer (Derek Chauvin) continued to pin Mr. Floyd with his knee on the ground, Mr. Floyd would die. Is there any way you could legally interfere and save his life? For example, would it be okay to step forward, announce something like: \"Officers I am completely unarmed. The way you are pinning that man is lethal (for XYZ reasons) and he will soon die if you continue. Please detain him in a non-lethal way.\" (*wait 10 seconds) \"Please stop or I will push you off.

Certainly if a landlord suspects illegal activity, they could contact the police, but this is a situation where the suspected activity is merely against the lease.

During the year the contract was in effect, their relationship was governed by an arbitration agreement. After the employee is terminated (and after the contract governing their relationship expired) the employee wishes to bring suit against the employer regarding a work injury (or some other suit) that occurred during his employment. Is the suit subject to the arbitration agreement? Or can it be argued that since the contract was terminated already, the arbitration agreement \"expired\" and can no longer bind them to arbitrate even though the suit is based on something that occurred while the arbitration agreement was still in effect? While my gut feeling is that something like this is subject to arbitration, I'm wondering if there are any case precedents to support this assumption, especially in NJ? In short, the question is whether a suit brought after the expiration of a contract, where the merits of the claim is based on pr-expiration time frame, is subject to arbitration or not? CLARIFICATION: While this question is similar to this one it is not the same. In that question the employee disputes the validity of termination so there are reasons to argue that the contract is still in effect. In this question, there is no disagreement between the employer and employee that the employee was properly terminated and the contract is no longer active. However, since the dispute relates to an incident that occurred while the arbitration agreement was active, the question is whether one of the parties can compel arbitration. Moreover, the top answer in that question primarily focuses on the fact that it is unlikely that the contract truly expired in that case. It merely transitioned from one phase to another. In this case, I am painting a scenario where there is no doubt at all that the contract expired. While there is some similarities between the two cases, my point in this question is to focus only on one specific component: Does it depend on what gave rise to dispute or when the dispute is being brought to court? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Can an Employer Enforce Arbitration After the Expiration of a Contract in NJ?"}

That clause turns this law into an ex post facto criminal law. As I understand, Article 20(1) of the Constitution of India prohibits the governments in India from enacting an ex post facto criminal law. Here's what the relevant clause states: (1) No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the Act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. So, is the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 (aka Triple Talaq law) violative of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution? It is to be noted that the Act came into existence to prevent the violation of Article 14 and 21 (fundamental rights) guaranteed by the same constitution. Backstory: the Bill for the law was first introduced in the winter session (2018) of the Parliament of India in the wake of the Indian Supreme Court's judgement (August 2018) which declared such instantaneous divorces unconstitutional and asked the Government of India to frame a law to protect the rights of the concerned women. The Bill lapsed automatically following the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha (2014-19). Following the constitution of 17th Lok Sabha in mid 2019, an amended Bill was tabled in the Parliament and was passed by both of its Houses, and received the assent of the President by the end of July. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Is the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act violative of fundamental rights?"}

Turns out that 'tenant' that my agent has found is a company and not a person (which already feels dodgy since we agreed with agent that it will be a person), so I started doing some research. It turns out that this company ('Company X') is company that helps asylum seekers with getting accommodation (which I am happy with as long as I don't have problems to deal with). However having done some (bad) enterprises to day, I got a bit more thorough (paranoid) and one potential possibility I see is that 'Company X' which has very little assets can sign hundreds of lease contracts with lenders like myself. This company places hundreds of asylum seeker families into flats with intention to pay their rents, but with no monetary 'buffer' or due to bad management (or many other potential reasons) fails to make payments. After it fails to make payments in around 2-3 months of non payments this goes to court, then 'Company X' goes bankrupt and gets liquidated in another 3-6 months all the while flat is occupied by non paying tenants that do not have direct obligation to myself but rather to the company that is going bankrupt. Netherlands is a very pro-tenant country so question is: if payments by 'Company X' fail can I start eviction process immediately (like I would normally do with tenants) or do I need to wait for company to get liquidated and only then can start eviction process? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Tenant eviction law in Netherlands when renting is done via proxy company"}

However, the landlord can begin the eviction process immediately, even if the rent is only one day overdue. The landlord also cannot use a reverse penalty clause to encourage you to pay early. For example, it is illegal for a landlord to reduce the rent by 10% if the rent is paid within the first five days of the month.

During the rainy seasons of 2017-2018 and the very wet 2018-2019, the tenant reported, on multiple occasions, leaks from the roof. These never seemed to have been properly addressed. More recently, there was a severe enough leak that caused some damage by splattering as it dripped. The water is a dark rust color, and stains everything it touches. More recently, water trapped in the ceiling insulation (which is held up by a plastic barrier) proved to be too heavy for the plastic and it ruptured, leaking all over numerous belongings. The landlord is unwilling to cover this damage, telling me that's what the tenant's insurance is for. The tenant has insurance that should cover this, but one of the few obligations the lease places on the landlord is to keep the roof in good working order. What are the legal options? It's very hard to search for information for commercial leases; almost everything online is about residential leases. EDIT: Is the landlord typically liable for damage to contents in a situation like this (that is, when they've failed to maintain the roof in proper working order, and the resulting water ingress damages the contents)? Or is it some kind of standard practice that the tenant's insurance should pay, and then the insurance company deals with the landlord? The next question is, what kind of attorney handles this sort of thing? The most important thing is to get the landlord to fix the roof to prevent further damage.

Thus, they have had multiple cases dismissed, yet they find ways of continuing to file different objections to the government action to show the people that they are asking for money from that they are still fighting and can absolutely win this thing.

This kind of law is not supposed to be applied when a person makes a threat against someone attacking them. In NH the phraseology is as follows: 631:4:IV. A person who responds to a threat which would be considered by a reasonable person as likely to cause serious bodily injury or death to the person or to another by displaying a firearm or other means of self-defense with the intent to warn away the person making the threat shall not have committed a criminal act under this section.

Please edit it if you have a better one for the question! This question arose from a comment on a related question which I posted. The question was deemed worth of its own post. I rephrase it a bit here to apply more generally. Suppose I have a barn which needs refurbishing for the big Stack Exchange Gala[*] I'm holding at the end of the year. I contract a builder to do the repair work; we agree \u00a310k for the work, to be paid on completion. There is a clause in the contract which states something along the lines of, \"the builder cannot be held liable if the work cannot be done due to sickness or circumstances outside of her control\". (An example of this might be some type of force majeure clause.) Pandemic hits. She can't do the work. Pandemic clears in time for party (wishful thinking) but I can't host because she didn't do the work. I lose out on earnings I would have got from hosting. I can't sue her for those lost earnings due to the lack of liability clause. (I'm pretty sure this is the case.) However, does the liability clause mean that can she still charge me \u00a310k for the building work which wasn't done?

How is s. 18 \"in at least one respect, broader than section 20\"? Are there more respects than just \"one respect\"? How many exactly? What are they? Herring, Criminal Law: Text, Cases, and Materials (8 edn, 2018). p. 372. offence under section 47 because it may not be easy to demonstrate that there was a battery or an assault?251 Although the Law Commission252 and many commentators are convinced by these arguments there are a few commentators who are willing to stand up for the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. One of the strongest defences of the Act is provided by John Gardner. In the following extract, he replies to some of the objections mentioned previously. He starts by challenging the claim that the Act is irrational: J. Gardner, \u2018Rationality and the Rule of Law in Offences against the Person\u2019 (1994) 53 Cambridge Law Journal 502 at 503\u201311 The rationality argument figures less prominently in the Law Commission\u2019s latest report than it does in the consultation paper which preceded it. One can only speculate as to the causes of its demotion, but its spirit certainly lives on in the draft Bill. The spirit of the argument is captured in the Commission\u2019s comment that \u2018sections 18, 20 and 47 of the 1861 Act . . . were not drafted with a view to setting out the various offences with which they deal in a logical or graded manner\u2019. The assumption is that the three offences can, in substance, be graded, and that this would be the logical way to define and organise them. Between them they deal with matters which would most naturally be dealt with in a hierarchy of more and less serious offences all conforming to a standard definitional pattern. The irrationality of the 1861 Act lies in its failure to take this natural path, its failure to carry the underlying hierarchy of seriousness over into the actual definition and organisation of the offences. Thus, section 18 should be regarded, in substance, as an aggravated version of section 20; and yet there are miscellaneous differences between the two sections which do not appear to bear any rational relation to the aggravation. Likewise, section 20 should be regarded, in substance, as the more serious cousin of section 47; and yet the two offences are drafted in quite different terms, so that the essential difference in point of seriousness is obscured by a mass of other, utterly irrelevant differences. If the sections were properly graded in definition as they are in substance, then section 18 would surely cover a narrower class of cases than section 20 which would cover a narrower class of cases than section 47; and yet section 47 is, in at least one respect, the narrowest offence of the three, while section 18 is, in at least one respect, broader than section 20. That is surely irrational. The law on such matters should be thoroughly governed, in the Law Commission\u2019s words, \u2018by clear distinctions . . . between serious and less serious cases\u2019. That a section 18 offence should be regarded, in substance, as a more serious version of a section 20 offence is easy enough to understand. Section 20 covers malicious wounding and the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm. Section 18 covers malicious wounding and maliciously causing grievous bodily harm, when these things are done with intention to do grievous bodily harm or to prevent or resist arrest. The extra element of intention required for a section 18 offence obviously accounts for the difference between the sentencing maxima (five years\u2019 imprisonment under section 20 and life under section 18), and marks a difference in point of seriousness (or potential seriousness) which the Law Commission is rightly anxious to retain in its hierarchy of replacement offences. The Commission has not even felt the need to explain its decision, however, to eliminate the difference in the causal elements of sections 18 and 20. Section 20 requires that grievous bodily harm be inflicted, 251 In fact, in the light of DPP v K [1990] 1 All ER 331 there is likely to be a battery. 252 Law Commission (2014). \nTITLE: ", "output": "Offences Against the Person Act 1861 \u2014 How is Section 18 , in at least one respect broader than Section 20?"}

I get little financial aid to offset the cost of attendance of over $80,000 per year. For the next three years, I would expect to pay around $250,000 for my education. My parents are generously offering to pay for my education but the details of where they are getting the money from, I do not know. Additionally, I feel morally obligated to pay them back. My friend is a high school senior who is planning on going out-of-state (we both live in Florida). Her financial aid situation is a little better, but she\u2019s still expected to pay around $40,000 per year for four years. We both go to schools that meet full demonstrated financial need. But my EFC on FAFSA is over $65k. That explains why I get such little financial aid. We\u2019re exploring the possibility of entering a marriage of convenience in Florida. That way, we can be considered independents on FAFSA. Running the net price calculator at our schools, we would nominally pay nothing for both of us, saving ourselves from hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. I make around 11k per year and she makes 3k per year. I have around 10k in checking accounts/investments and she has around 2k. We intend on divorcing after graduations. I\u2019ve done some preliminary research and came up with these points: We will get in touch with a family lawyer to draft an iron clad prenup. In particular, we want to ensure our assets going into the marriage remain separate, any of our earnings remain separate, and to include clauses that preclude alimony and child support if necessary. I understand marriage comes with many tax and legal implications. My parents may still want to claim me as a dependent. I read they could still do this if we file our tax returns married separately. What if I still live with my parents during this marriage? Do I need to declare their financial support on my tax returns/FAFSA? Please poke holes in my theory and see what I can do to plug them up.

The officer attempts to barge in, and the owner defends himself, say by pressing against the door to the shed with heavy objects, making extremely loud noise to get the officer to leave, or anything else that would make the situation dangerous or unplesant for the officer in efforts to get him to leave and prevent an \"unreasonable search and seizure\". \nTITLE: ", "output": "How far can I go to protect my 4th amendment right?"}

However, they bailed once they got paid in full from the financial company. Before I knew that they were playing games they kept giving me a whole run around every other day with a different excuse why they can't come. In the winter they said the weather is too cold. now over the summer they started working but then one day they didn't show up. When I called they said it's cause of rain (where they're located but not where my house is) Another day it was being delayed for a couple weeks. Then I was told it's the holidays, and one time they even said a workers family member passed away stalling an other couple weeks. There were a lot of excuses and now they told me that they can't work until there is a straight week without rain. We had plenty times beautiful days and weeks and they just keep ignoring my emails or phone calls asking when they're resuming work since we are having a nice forecast, but they sometimes pickup and give me a false promise for few days or some other excuse. Then I contacted the financial company asking why they paid out in full without consulting with me if the job was completed. They told me there was no need to, and something about that it says in the contract. I don't see anywhere mentioning that. I'm thinking of contacting a lawyer but I don't know what kind I'm looking for. Somebody told me that because they have a clause in the contract \"if weather permitted\u201d then that's why they could keep pushing this off this way. I don't know how to go about this. Should I first stop paying the financial company monthly untill this gets resolved? Should I contact the contractor boss directly and tell him I'll make a lawsuit, before I contact a lawyer? Or should I get a lawyer first before I do anything? Are there clauses in the contract that getting a lawyer will just end up costing me instead of getting my money back?

Background In watching the Chauvin trial, I've noticed that the defence lawyer tends to ask questions by stating the desired answer and then saying \"right?\". And, sometimes, it seems that he follows a series of things that are easily agreed to, with the question he really wants to have answered in his favour. I notice that witnesses can sometimes be lulled into answering \"yes\" by the initial questions and then (am I imagining this) being tricked into answering \"yes\" to the final question in the sequence. When the prosecution employs a similar pattern, there is usually an objection about leading the witness, and it's usually sustained. But I don't tend to hear such objections when the defence does it. Question. Is this a normal pattern? If so, why? I can think of some reasons, e.g. (1) a preference to lean towards defence, so the state does not clobber citizens, (2) a choice of the prosecution not to appear to be bullying, (3) a pattern in this one trial, not reflective of others and (4) my misconception of events. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Are leading-witness rules applied equally to prosecution and defence?"}

Background I recently transferred my home loan to a new bank. When the new bank paid down the balance on the old loan, they actually sent about $2200 more than the balance outstanding, leaving the account in credit. Shortly after this occurred, I requested that the old bank withdraw the surplus amount for me, so that it could be deposited back with the new bank. They refused on the grounds that the loan account was being closed and I had to wait for that to occur. Some weeks passed, and I received a letter from the old bank, which in essence said \"we're keeping your loan account open indefinitely unless you advise us otherwise in writing, if you have a credit balance on your loan you may redraw it\". So I went back to the branch, and again asked for the credit balance to be withdrawn. Again they refused, and we spent some time arguing the point. Their branch manager insisted that there's legislation in place which requires them to keep the credit balance. I asked to see the relevant legislation, but of course the manager didn't comply. I left them with the following written instructions after it became clear that they had absolutely no intention of actually helping me: As far as I can tell, they've acted on exactly none of those. So my question is, does any legislation exist that would give the bank grounds to hold my funds against my explicit wishes, or is what the bank's doing essentially theft? Update It took them a few days (5 business days, to be exact), but they eventually followed all of the instructions I provided (excluding #4, as they did not charge any fees).

Back in October 2021 said media posted an article about a recent videogame release, going into details about how to emulate it and how emulation provided a better experience than playing the game on the actual console due to increased resolution and other similar benefits. The article is fully visible on the Way Back Machine here. Following are the main passages. So... the first passage jokes about the article being something that could cause them troubles with a \"lawyer\" the second passage claims that \"all you need is a PCand an emulator\". But that is not true: you need also a copy of the game and a modded Switch (since making the \"ROM backup\" yourself is the only legal way to get a ROM afaik, and even that probably isn't true in every country). The only way to just need an emulator is if you download the game from a pirate site. the final paragraph takes the prize with the \"Thank God for pirates\" line Basically the whole article looks like it just advocating for piracy and suggesting that customers should commit a crime to \"pay less\". The article caused a lot of controversy, to the point that it was edited just a day later. The article was edited again and again, and currently it ends with these notices. I guess that thanks to Nintendo own involvement things went just \"too fast\" for actual law enforcers to get on the case, but after the same site was recently involved in another scandal about posting info on a yet-to-be released title that was leaked and thus available illegally on the web I had some exchanges with other users on SE that lead to this question. Would the original version of the Metroid article be enough to be consider \"Incitement to piracy\" and thus be an explicit violation of law in any country? And even if this specific example would not be enough to be acted on, would an hypothetical article that makes the \"suggestion\" even more explicit violate the laws? Personally I don't see the original version of the article to be defensible in any way due to the considerations I made before, in my opinion there is no way to interpret the article as anything else than an incitement to pirate the game. But since I am not a lawyer nor a student in laws I would like for a more based view from users with more experience in the area. Small clarification: while I have mentioned the revised article for sake of context, please ignore it when answering. My actual question is if the original version without any revision would constitute \"Incitement\" and in case it would not if a made-up even more direct article could. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Would an online article suggesting readers to perform piracy constitute \"Incitement\" under any jurisdition?"}

Eve will say things that's obviously a lie. Eve will say she works for Charlie, she will say she has items she doesn't have, the bank accounts may be real but most likely fake.

So he doesn't send money. Instead Charlie reports Eve's to cops. Will the cops arrest Eve? Someone told me that if Charlie didn't rely on Eve's statement, then no fraud occur yet.

Since 1997, the Canadian Copyright Act allows plaintiffs suing for copyright infringement to elect to recover statutory damages instead of going through the exercise of quantifying actual damages that were suffered or incurred by the copyright owner or actual profits earned by the rogue. Where the infringement is for commercial purposes, the range of statutory damages starts with a minimum of $500 per work infringed and goes up to a maximum of $20,000 per work infringed. If the infringement is for non-commercial purposes, then there is a cap of $5,000 for all works involved. That cap is an attempt to discourage film and music plaintiffs from suing individuals for their home file sharing activities. For example, a content user (file sharer) who copies 1,000 songs for monetary profit would be liable for up to $2 million in statutory damages, while a content user who copies the same 1,000 songs for personal use only would be liable for up to $5,000 because of the cap. https://boyneclarke.com/blogs/what-are-statutory-damages-for-copyright-infringement/ It seems under Canadian law copyright infringement from scientific plagiarism can result in a $5,000 fine, but because you can sell your scientific articles it's possible it's actually $20,000, but is this correct and are damages from scientific plagiarism covered by a different Canadian law? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Do Canadian courts distinguish copyright infringement from scientific plagiarism?"}

{"input": "Generate a concise, engaging title for the following legal question on an internet forum. The title should be legally relevant, capture key aspects of the issue, and entice readers to learn more. \nQUESTION: I recently came across an article on the internet containing the following passage: \"Nearly all [of] the evidence that he [Alito] cites [in the recent-leaked draft of an opinion that would overturn Roe vs. Wade] shows that * pre-quickening * ... abortion was not criminalized\" at the time that the 14th amendment to the US Constitution was adopted. (By the way I don't know what to make of those stars around the word \"pre-quickening\" -- perhaps quotation marks or a text effect like bold or italic text.) Alito's claim that the right to an abortion is not \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition\" rests on similarly faulty ground. To back up his claim that abortion rights are not \"deeply rooted,\" Alito cites the fact that 28 of the 37 states banned abortion throughout pregnancy at the time of the adoption of the 14th amendment, which contains the Due Process Clause that the court in Roe relied on to grant abortion rights. Alito's argument about how the common law treated abortion is also remarkably weak, Adam Winkler, a constitutional law professor at UCLA Law School, tweeted on Wednesday. Nearly all the evidence that he cites shows that * pre-quickening * (about 16 weeks), abortion was not criminalized.\" Is that legal opinion right? It seems pretty obvious to me that the right to an abortion is not deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition. Is the point genuinely open to question? Is Mr. Winkler right to say (if he does say) that abortion was generally legal for 16 weeks, roughly the first half of normal pregnancy? Some May 6th Reflections The response so far is puzzling. I don\u2019t follow what phoog is saying at all. Alito\u2019s argument is that abortion was a crime and therefore obviously not a right deeply rooted in the nation\u2019s history and tradition. Winkler\u2019s argument is that abortion was generally legal under certain circumstances and so still plausibly a right deeply rooted in the nation\u2019s history and tradition. I agree that Winkler claims that the legality of abortion is evident from Alito\u2019s own citations; this might be relevant to our view of Alito\u2019s integrity or ability, but seems irrelevant to the central point that abortion was generally legal (under certain circumstances) and therefore (at least possibly) a right deeply rooted in the nation\u2019s history and tradition. Likewise, while I agree with the formal distinction between the two questions (\u201cWas it a right deeply rooted\u201d and \u201cWas it legal to 16 weeks\u201d), the two questions are so closely interwoven in the argument that it seems rather pedantic to distinguish them while answering neither. Dale asks what historical research I have done to conclude that \u201cit\u2019s pretty obvious.\u201d Rather than go that route let me withdraw that claim, as I really made it just to clarify the question. I don\u2019t follow Dale\u2019s argument that abortion was common. If people have sex more often than they have children, this could be because they use contraceptives or have sex in some other way calculated to avoid pregnancy, they have sex while already pregnant (or with someone already pregnant), or they have sex while incapable of conceiving for some other medical reason. Miscarriage may have been common. But of course, even failing all of these alternatives, people still have sex more often than they have children because not every instance of sexual intercourse leads to a pregnancy even under favorable circumstances. According to a website called Statistica, the US fertility rate was a bit over 7 in 1800, the earliest year they report; and the US life expectancy was 40 in 1860, the earliest year they report. Given that fertility rate was falling (so higher in the past) and life expectancy was rising (so lower in the past), it seems plausible that lots of women were pregnant through a huge part of their adult lives. And the fact of laws against abortion does not prove that abortion is common; there are laws against the assassination of the president, but assassinations are rare. But then Dale says that given \u201cthat abortion was common, evidence is needed to overturn that presumption.\u201d Dale also says that \u201cevidence that abortion was illegal is not evidence that it wasn\u2019t common.\u201d This is another turn that I cannot follow. It was Dale that raised the question of commonness, while Alito, Winkler and I were all discussing whether abortion was legal. What relationship exists between the idea that behavior is common and the idea that it is a right deeply rooted in the nation\u2019s history and tradition? If we did know that, say, picking pockets was a common phenomenon at some time and place, how would that bear on the constitutionality of a statute forbidding it? Dale says that speeding is common despite the law against it; is that law constitutional? But now I\u2019ve asked lots of questions, and I really meant to ask this one: Is the right to an abortion \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition?\" \nTITLE: ", "output": "Is the right to an abortion \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition?\""}

But what about if the business keeps growing this way (above \"small business\" thresholds)? e.g. The owner only hiring people he discovers, and after that's infeasible, his highest trusted managers. I'm thinking of situations where you come to understand the skills somebody has and you say \"Hey! You'd be really good at helping out with X work. You want a job?\". You already know the person is timely, respectful, \"fits the culture\" etc. To say another way: the business never advertises, but instead only invites individuals to work for them. It could even include a non-discriminatory screening interview to check suitability for the business' goals. I can't find any information in any jurisdiction about discrimination related to selecting individuals for employment and \"creating a role to fit\" Added later: I think it helps if you let go of capitalism and the idea that an organisation's purpose would be to maximise it's profits by generating valuable goods. Think instead of an organisation that was founded with charitable intent and the business' value creation is of a more intangible manner: behavioural / relational / mental / spiritual.

However the Title IX office of a university does not attempt to tackle behaviors that fall outside of ensuring compliance with the federal law. Usually, faculty and staff are required to report or consult with the Title IX office if they become aware of misconduct. However, there is also a belief I have encountered that legally, academic personnel must then \"back off\" and completely withdraw from any conversations, actions, or other matters that relate to the issue and allow the Title IX office alone to handle it. Is there any form of legal concern for an academic department, or faculty/staff, acting on this information further? For example, can a department chair enact sanctions on a perpetrator? Can faculty confront the perpetrator and demand their behavior cease? Can it even be discussed without legal ramifications?

The title should be legally relevant, capture key aspects of the issue, and entice readers to learn more. \nQUESTION: Background Most internet feeds are unfiltered. Everyone who has ever rented or set up a server knows malicious traffic comes in from all over the world, including the European Union (but mostly from other places), as soon as a server is online, and passwords, keys, and/or facilities to firewall malicious traffic need to be ready beforehand. Scenario Small Town News USA Inc. (a fictional company) operates a newspaper and web site about Small Town, USA. Primary customers live in Small Town, USA. Recently, their corporate lawyer has suggested they need to pay several thousand dollars to do preparation and paperwork for European GDPR regulatory compliance that affects businesses worldwide with any EU citizen data. Management, thinking it would be less expensive to filter and inconvenience maybe 5-10 travelers and remote viewers who are accessing the website from Europe, decides that the easiest way to deal with GDPR liability is to reject internet traffic from non-USA viewers. Unfortunately, the commonly available technology to do this involves IP-sniffing. In more detail, a web server is designated as a \"firewall/Nginx-reverse-proxy\" and would take a connection , examine the IP address (personally identifiable information under GDPR; see FAQ What Constitutes Personal Data?) and then forward only USA connections to a different server containing the Small Town News web site. But \"Rejected\" connections are still processed by sending back a web page containing only: \"Sorry, we can't serve you at your current location.\" IP addresses and times are recorded in the web server logs. Furthermore, IT staff want web server logs to include IP addresses so that they can ban malicious traffic. This involves automated processing of behavioral data and also storing bad-behavior IPs in other files that update the firewall data, which is held in an operating system table. It turns out the USA-only filter is an imperfect technological measure. It does not filter out 100% of EU-resident traffic. First, there is no perfect mapping of IP addresses to locations. For instance, an IP address apparently owned by the US Navy could be traffic coming from an EU-resident civilian contractor on his lunch hour who works at a US naval base in, e.g. Italy. An EU-resident visitor to the USA could still access the full website from the USA. Another EU-resident could buy VPN (Virtual Private Network) service to disguise their computer's true location, and that could involve forwarding their traffic from a point within the USA which would allow fetching the full Small Town News website because the Small Town News firewall received a USA IP address. Enforcement For those who think this is scaremongering and unenforceable, perhaps read: How the EU can fine US companies for violating GDPR which isn't entirely certain, but does suggest the possibility of US cooperation for collecting EU civil fines. Maybe Location-sniffing is also illegal... The article \"Why the US and Other Non-European Companies Need to Comply with the GDPR\" on busineessknowhow.com claims: \"... identifying people within the EU and refusing them access to your site or service based on the geolocation of their IP address - is actually specifically prohibited by GDPR. GDPR contains a prohibition against 'profiling', which GDPR defines as \"any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, LOCATION or movements.\" Since this doesn't cite specific sections of the 100+ page regulation, I don't know if it is correct. It all sounds like a great welfare project for lawyers, regulators, and IT pros who take the time to specialize in this area and bad for the creative entrepreneur who simply wants to put something online. Question Is Small Town News GDPR compliant under their (unfortunate) EU-blocking policy? Or can they only become compliant by outsourcing the filtering to some other company, who can be the scapegoat when filtering is imperfect? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Is it possible for non-EU companies to avoid GDPR regulatory issues through filters and firewalls?"}

Email marketing requires opt-in, as does SMS marketing. Email marketing services such as Mailchimp ask how you got your list of addresses, and how the opt-in was done. SMS services such as Twilio talk about opt-ins as well. The question is in two parts. What is required for a legal opt-in, and what kinds of services have the opt-in requirement. First, what exactly is required for opt-in? In this case, a single message invitation would be sent after someone you know provides your phone number. Basically a SMS or email friend request. Clearly you didn't give the service your phone number or email, but it wasn't generated by an auto-dialer or purchased from a bulk list. This is a communication from someone who claims to know you, inviting you to join a social service, but it is the service sending the message. If you decline or ignore the message, then you won't get more. Second, is this actually considered Spam? The service would be sending you a single invite to join, with the name of your friend in the message, and no more messages unless you reply or sign up. Once you join, then we have a business relationship and the SMS messages or emails are transactional as part of the service. You can also turn off notifications or even quit the service at any time. Reading online, most of the discussion seemed to only cover auto-dialer and list generated messages, not something as specific as my use-case. Transactional messages such as for password reset or account activity seem to always be allowed, and alerts or notifications seem to be okay as long as there is an opt-out or way to control what notifications are sent. It's the single invite message that I don't know about. If I was getting the emails and phone numbers from lists or an autodialer, then I'd say it was unsolicited bulk marketing, and should have an opt-in first. But since the email/number is provided by an individual to invite you to interact with them on the service, I think the auto-dialed, bulk, and unsolicited categories don't apply. Even then, I would only send the invite message once to any user or phone number, no matter how many of their friends try to invite them. I haven't been able to find anything authoritative to confirm or refute my theory though. I'm hoping someone here can tell me what law covers the email case and the SMS case, and if I can do this invite message legally without the recipient's prior opt-in. Also, if I can send a message, what language do I need to include in the message to ensure it is legal?

She used to be pretty autonomous and self managing. After restructuring her job responsibilities were completely changed and she was placed under an extremely micromanaging and controlling manager. The manager has no business knowledge about the job but does not listen to suggestions from my friend. Previously she was free to work remotely but now it is completely forbidden - she has to be in the office at 9am sharp for no reason other than pleasing the manager. All this is of course creating lots of tension between them. As a result my friend takes somewhat more sick days than usual, sometimes mainly to cope with the stress and anxiety. All these absences have been accepted by the company and any proof of illness was not required.

This is the document authored by a judge (or judges) giving their decision on a case. However, this information is by definition incomplete. I would like as complete a description of the case as possible, in particular including the submissions from the plaintiff/petitioner, as well as responses etc. The judgment by itself just includes whatever the judges feel like mentioning from the case documentation, and it's wholly inadequate as documentation of a case. If the other information is not recorded in an accessible form, that would be most unfortunate. So, I was wondering whether this information was available online, possibly as a paid service. If not, why not? While this seems like a obvious and simple question, I've not found any clear statement of this anywhere. However, given that I have failed to find it so far, it at least seems that this information, even if available somewhere, is not very accessible. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Information about Indian court cases available online"}

I guess the reason why this works is because to average person \"contract free\" typically means that you don't have to read fine print on a written contract that most of the time works against you. However, isn't this misleading advertising to claim that there is \"no contract\", because there always will be a contract - either verbal or written on a paper under different title (e.g. Application Form, \"Unicorn tears\")? Based on answer I received here, the person claimed that it does not matter what is the title of the document - so document with title \"Application Form\" could incorporate another document via reference that specifies terms. Effectively you actually end up having a contract, but the only difference is that you did not explicitly sign the referenced document and did not have a chance to read it; and this works against you. Or another person confirmed here that there does not have to be any paper signed at all for judge to think that there was a contract in the first place. Also, another person told here that the terms don't need to explicitly be mentioned in the first place, if price (and possibly late fees) were omitted from contract, then judge will figure out what is fair. What would judge do if you were able to prove that other party claimed that their service is \"contract free\"? If sales person was honest would he have to explain to the other party that \"contract free\" actually means: You know our service is only \"written contract fee\" and not \"contract free\". However, this is the exact reason why you would have to be really dumb to enter into business with us orally or just via Application Form, because now instead of just dealing with the fine print issue that you would have had with written contract, now you will also have to deal with incorporation by reference issue where we can incorporate terms and conditions from Application Form into our website or somewhere else; also, now instead of knowing what are the exact fees (e.g. ETF, late fees) that we would charge from you we will simply charge whatever we think is \"fair amount\". If you disagree with the amount of fees we charge, then no worries judge will decide what is fair for you. However, remember, just because that we did not disclose such fees in contract it does not mean that we can't charge them from you. Does monologue from \"honest\" sales guy above really explains how our legal system works, if there is \"no contract\"? Note that this question is only asked from legal point of view and not from building good relationship point of view. I will wait for multiple answers before accepting the right one. I will give preference to that answer that will be backed up with precedent case where judge discusses meaning of \"no contract\". \nTITLE: ", "output": "Does there really exist such thing as \"no contract\" when doing business with other party?"}

The case is a civil one between two private companies, the plaintiff alleging copyright infringement for commercial gain, and the defendant is arguing the works were fair use. The copyrighted works in question were mass-produced by the defendant, one of which I purchased several years ago, unaware of the legal dispute at the time. My purchase transaction (along with my full name, address, phone number and email) was produced by the defendant into evidence, on a record of hundreds of other transactions, along with all their other customers' personal information. That evidence became part of the public record once it entered the district courts, as far as I can tell.

I've already seen the document posted in un-redacted form on dozens of legal discussion forums, YouTube videos as B-roll footage, etc. when searching for articles on the case.

Social media companies (in addition to banks, payment processors, website hosting services, and more) are increasingly picking and choosing which clients they will serve. This picking and choosing is, I don't think can be denied at this point, based at least somewhat on the political opinions of these clients.

In general, the government forces American businesses to run any number of ways based on the laws they pass. We don't live in a libertarian / anarcho-capitalist environment, so this \"They're private companies\" argument has always struck me as disingenuous. I know it's a general question, but to what extent can companies pick and choose (that is, discriminate) what clients to serve?

As I understand it the graph itself is protected by copyright, not by virtue of the underlying data but on the creative expression in the graph, things like the colours of the lines, the symbols used to mark data points, perhaps the aspect ratio. I think this use would be covered by fair use, but that is judged on a case by case basis. If I did not want to rely on fair use, I could presumably take the underlying data (usually provided in the case of scientific publications), put it into my preferred graphing solution and produce my own copy of the graph, with different colours, icons and aspect ratio. I would then own the copyright on the resulting graphic. However, sometimes the underlying data is not readily available, but I could produced the exact same product by using say the gimp to change the colours, icons and aspect ratio.

They were not really usable as such in fear of splinters and if one would rely on them when he stumbles they would probably fall apart. The new ones are made of sturdy aluminum with LEDs for the night to see the steps better. So an improvement in every way. This certain neighbor immediately contacted the authorities and harassed the contractors as he considers them unsafe as they are just handrails without paling, so a small child could walk under it and fall into a small ditch where a funicular runs in parallel. In this specific case he mentions his grandchild who actually lives there, he only owns the house and rents it to his daughters family. I order some netting on the area where the fall to this ditch is above 1m, but for optics and the price I decided against it where the fall is only 50-60cm. I am aware if someone falls and gets injured, my insurance has to pay. But I don't see how he could force me to build a fence instead of just a handrail. Talking with other neighbors, everyone dislikes that guy and against few of them he already took legal action. One had to cut down a tree a previous owner planted a bit too close to his property. I am planning to a larger remodeling of my land and even though my property only touches his at a corner I fear he will again try to take legal action for whatever reason he feels fancy. How can I prevent this or is there even a legal action I can take against him if it turns out as I fear? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Is it considered harassment if a neighbor threatens with legal actions on whatever I do on my property"}

I don't have a burning desire to drive, but it would be nice for a few reasons. Driving with my parents is fine. Given this, I'd like to stay under a 'supervised instruction permit' (SIP), the \"you can drive, but only with a licensed adult\" version of a license. I also don't really want to go through driver's training and all that red tape.

For insurance purposes, it would be better for me to have an SIP. Can I get an SIP when I turn 17 without going through driver's training? For how long would it be valid?

I was advised to move this question to legal. Could anyone please advise me on my legal options in this case, and how I can gather evidence to prove the transgressions and legally punish them? tl;dr: An employee at a large national bank chain has been accessing and giving out confidential information about my bank account to my mother, with whom he/she is friends. I reported this unauthorized access to the bank's manager directly, who said that he would put an alert on my account to make sure that it does not happen again and that he would get back to me after an internal investigation was carried out. However, he never got back to me and never returned any of my calls again. A few months later, I opened a new bank account at another bank and transferred most of my funds to it. My mother then asked me shortly thereafter why I withdrew most of my money from my original bank account. Hence, the problem was not solved -- my bank account information is still being accessed without my permission and my privacy is being violated. Since I already reported this info to the bank's manager, I do not know what else to do to pursue any legal action towards the rogue employee who has been accessing (and releasing information) about my bank account to my mother. I want to know if I can pursue any legal options against the bank, my mother, or both. I do not want to close my original bank account because this would constitute a major inconvenience (since my wife, kids, and I bank there).

If I understood correctly, it deputizes private Texan individuals to sue pretty much everybody involved in a post-heartbeat abortion except the patient, and will reimburse their court costs up to $10,000. This approach seems absurd to me because it seems so easy to be a \"slippery slope\". Let's suppose the Supreme Court allows the Texas law to stand when it finally does make a decision, and then that all the states with anti-abortion legislatures pass laws like Texas'. Is there any extra legal barrier that would prevent states with pro-choice legislatures from passing laws designed to counter the anti-abortion deputies? For example, California could pass a law that deputizes private California individuals to sue people who sue abortion providers, and could reimburse their court costs up to $10,000. This hypothetical law seems equally absurd to me as the Texas one. (Of course there's a common sense barrier as to why California would want to pay for that, but let's ignore that because I expect there are states where strongly pro-choice people are actually willing to pay for it even without reimbursement. They just need the \"deputization\" giving them a green light. As an aside, I'm kind of surprised that some billionaire hasn't come forward and offered to pay court costs for any provider sued under Texas' crazy law.

For example: a permanent resident employed by a U.S. corporation may be temporarily assigned abroad which requires him or her to remain out of the United States for more than one year. They may be issued a nonimmigrant visa for the purpose of traveling to the United States for urgent business meeting and Form I-551 need not be surrendered.

However, the law doesn't seem to explain what conditions apply to a person admitted on such a B-1/B-2 visa. Indeed, the situation seems a bit contradictory: a B visa can only be issued to a person \"having a residence in a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning\", but if that's true, then the person has abandoned their residence in the US, and cannot avail themselves of the benefits of LPR status.

The employer claims they own any audio or video of private acts on it. It is a public governemnt entity.

All in all private use, explained to others I have no interest in them being recorded or its purpose wasnt for them. Is it legal for a local government employer to speculate use and claim ownership of personal use data in public for private self protection reasons in which tech they are part of the law enforcement and their attorney, threaten seizure of private use cell phone, audionvideo devices never used for work related purposes or the audio video lapel recorder. Some would joke robocop and it was handy I had it on vest so it wouldn't fall out or be stolen as I had a audio recorder stolen before when it fell out of a jacket vest onto the seat of the work vehicle and someone swiped it up within ten minutes.

He was held for several months pending extradition hearings, which itself does not make complete sense: presumably, the extradition hearings should have been conducted while he was serving the actual sentence. Why is he still being held in Belmarsh? I understand that after a very pro-extradition1 judge, overseen by one with serious conflicts2, struck down the American request for extradition, the Americans are appealing. Larger question However, my understanding is that if a judge finds someone guilty then they go to jail right away. And they have to file appeals while serving their sentence. Is the converse not true, i.e. if the judge finds someone not guilty and the government appeals, then doesn't the person contest the appeal as a free person? 1 Of her 24 previous extradition hearings, Vanessa Baraitser ordered extradition in 23. 2 Vanessa Baraitser is overseen by Emma Arbuthnot who has refused to formally recuse herself despite family connections to people cited for criminal activities in documents published by WikiLeaks. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Why is Julian Assange in jail?"}

Currently we can employ experts to detect whether such images are genuine or not. However as technology progresses, this will become less-and-less feasible. (Note, my background is in technology) For example, one established method of making such fakes more realistic is to pit another AI against them. The second AI attempts to distinguish between real and fabricated images. The first AI then learns from this and tries to fool the second AI more effectively, and so on. This purely machine-based co-evolution can happen very quickly and produces better and better fakes and better and better detectors. At some point, fakes will become so good that even other machines will not be able to detect the difference. I see two problems with respect to presenting digital evidence in court: The guilty can claim that any digital evidence is fake. The innocent will be unable to produce any convincing digital alibi and could be portrayed doing something that they did not (perhaps by digitally-altered CCTV footage).

Provincial and Territorial The provincial superior courts, as noted above, are constituted under section 92(14) of the Constitution Act, 1867, with their judges appointed federally under section 96 of the Act. Because of this they are sometimes referred to as section 96 courts. Why are the judges in these provincial courts appointed federally? Though these are provincial courts, they can, under section 92(14), hear not only matters falling under provincial legislative power (for example, motor vehicle accident cases) but also some matters falling under federal legislative power (for example, bankruptcy cases). (See Chapter 5 for a discussion of how legislative power is divided under Canada's Constitution.) The fact that the judges in these provincial superior courts are federally appointed ensures balance. Balance is needed because of the power these provincial courts have to adjudicate certain federal matters.

How unfathomable would it be for a radical/renegade anti imperialist law student to rise through the ranks of the German prosecutorial or judiciary services and make a big wave by prosecuting American troops for their army's criminal adventures around the world along the lines of Baltasar Garzon in Spain?

VA has two United States District Courts: Western and Eastern. The permanent resident would like to file a lawsuit against the USCIS. One of the defendants is the head of the USCIS Field Office at Norfolk, VA, which is now responsible for the permanent resident's case, based on his zip code. So, the permanent resident resides in one district (the Western district), but his rights were violated by the USCIS field office which is in another district (the Eastern district). The permanent resident wants to file a lawsuit according to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(b): (b) Request for hearing before district court If there is a failure to make a determination under section 1446 of this title before the end of the 120-day period after the date on which the examination is conducted under such section, the applicant may apply to the United States district court for the district in which the applicant resides for a hearing on the matter. Such court has jurisdiction over the matter and may either determine the matter or remand the matter, with appropriate instructions, to the Service to determine the matter. So, the law specifies that the permanent resident should file his lawsuit in the United States district court for the district in which the applicant resides, i.e. the Western District. However, it would be reasonable to say that the actions or inactions that violated the permanent resident's rights occurred in the USCIS Norfolk Field Office, which is in the Eastern District. A quote from the US District Court for the Western District of Virginia's PRO SE HANDBOOK: 3. VENUE: Is the Western District of Virginia the appropriate federal court in which to file my lawsuit? If you decide that there is jurisdiction to bring your claim in a federal court, you must then determine in which federal court to file. In order to decide a case, a court must have some logical relationship either to the litigants or to the subject matter of the dispute; this is called venue. There are two United States District Courts in Virginia: the Eastern District and the Western District. Generally, you may only file an action in the Western District of Virginia if the actions or inactions that you believe violated your rights occurred within the boundaries of this District. According to the above resource, the permanent resident should file his lawsuit in the United States district court for the district in which his rights were violated, i.e. the Eastern District. In which district should the permanent resident file his lawsuit then? \nTITLE: ", "output": "In which United States District Court should a permanent resident file a lawsuit against the USCIS?"}

{"input": "Generate a concise, engaging title for the following legal question on an internet forum. The title should be legally relevant, capture key aspects of the issue, and entice readers to learn more. \nQUESTION: Background: Last year I had a problematic tenant in our (owned by my mother) apartment in Germany. He was repeatedly late/not paying the rent and not responding to phone calls or letters. Around the same time I decided to move into this apartment with my family and informed the tenant that he must vacate the apartment with three months notice. He initially acknowledged this, but that was exactly when he failed to pay the rent for that and the subsequent month. Fearing that he might not honor the agreement to vacate the apartment in time, I contacted a lawyer. Interaction with the lawyer: As the rent was not paid for two months in a row, I had grounds to order the tenant to vacate the apartment immediately. Over the course of four e-mails I asked the lawyer about the possible procedural costs of eviction, steps which I should take to raise the chances of the apartment being vacated, etc. As a result of our interaction the best course of action seemed to be to strengthen the request to free the apartment for my own use with an additional threat of eviction. To leave a paper trail I sent the tenant a final warning to pay the debt in full or be evicted. I told the lawyer, that we'll see what happens next, then if he doesn't pay, we'll start taking steps to kick him out. However, the tenant paid, therefore I no longer had grounds to evict him immediately (though he still had to leave after the above-mentioned three months notice). Since then I did not contact the lawyer again, a couple of months later the tenant vacated the apartment on time and I moved in. Bill: Recently I received a bill from the lawyer, claiming a \"business fee\" (Gesch\u00e4ftsgeb\u00fchr) under the code VV 2300, a bit over 700 euro. This seems to imply certain actions being taken by the lawyer, such as contacting third parties (e.g. the tenant), involving local authorities, etc. I am of the opinion, that none of this took place (see details below) and instead he should charge me only with a consultation fee (Beratungsgeb\u00fchr), which is, by law, capped at 250 EUR (+19% VAT + 20 euro postage/telecom). Re-reading my emails, I do not see any explicit requests from my side to take any legally meaningful steps. Indeed, all I pursued was legal advice. There may or may not have been implicit requests, but I'm of the opinion that there have been none. At a certain point he offered to draft up a certain letter and send it to me, as soon as I provide him with some bits of info such as the rental contract. I provided him with the info, but ignored the offer, instead asking further questions about my situation. In any case I did not receive this letter. Question: Is the lawyer in his right to charge the business fee, rather than the smaller consultancy fee? If so, on what grounds is that/could that be? If not, how can I challenge his claim? I realize, that a logical answer may be to go and ask him. However, as you can see, simply talking to a lawyer can already incur costs without the need for a formal written contract. Therefore I do not wish to call or write to him until I am better informed. Thankfully, as the sidebar says, Communications on Law Stack Exchange are not privileged communications and do not create an attorney-client relationship. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Can a lawyer charge the business fee (Gesch\u00e4ftsgeb\u00fchr) when my interaction with amounts only to an e-mail exchange?"}

But the charge NEVER showed up on my VISA. The card has expired. Now, 4 months later, the travel agency is demanding the money. I am wondering If I need to pay? What does the LAW say about this? Thanks. Thank you guys for the comments. I live in Canada. The agency that sold the ticket is in the Netherland, and the ticket was purchased online in Thailand, so the jurisdiction is not clear. I am new here, I think the \"law\" section is more appropriate but I have no idea how to move the question. Of course if I purchase a service and use it, I should pay for it. However, in this case there is an important \"time component\" attached. The ticket is a #3000, and at the time I purchased it, I had the money available and ready to pay for it. I purchased it believing I will be billed immediately, and it is on the travel agency that they did not bill me. Now, 4.5 months after the fact, the necessary cash is not available, the purchase itself was attached to a certain point in time, not months later. It is not reasonable for me to put $3000 on hold in case one day sometime in the future they decide to bill me, after 30 days, I assumed I will never hear from them. Anyway, I decided to to what I think is the right thing, and offered to pay half, right away, to settle this issue, providing they reply to my email with \"we confirm that half the payment will be considered payment in full, and this matter will be considered closed\", surprisingly, they thanked me for my offer, but did not confirm this will end the issue. \nTITLE: ", "output": "I paid for an airline ticket, I took the flight, but NEVER got charged"}

The approval referred to in the first sentence of section 202(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act shall be considered to have been granted, effective beginning with fiscal year 1991, with respect to Hong Kong as a separate foreign state, and not as a colony or other component or dependent area of another foreign state, except that the total number of immigrant visas made available to natives of Hong Kong under subsections (a) and (b) of section 203 of such Act in each of fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993 may not exceed 10,000. This allows people born in Hong Kong to not be subject to the long waits for visa numbers for people born in Mainland China in certain employment-based categories, as well as allowing them to be eligible for the Diversity Visa while people born in Mainland China aren't. Recently, President Trump issued Executive Order 13936, which terminates Hong Kong's treatment under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, with respect to certain laws, including section 103 of the Immigration Act of 1990: Sec. 2. Pursuant to section 202 of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (22 U.S.C. 5722), I hereby suspend the application of section 201(a) of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, as amended (22 U.S.C. 5721(a)), to the following statutes: (a) section 103 of the Immigration Act of 1990 (8 U.S.C. 1152 note); 22 USC 5722(a) says: (a) Presidential determination On or after July 1, 1997, whenever the President determines that Hong Kong is not sufficiently autonomous to justify treatment under a particular law of the United States, or any provision thereof, different from that accorded the People\u2019s Republic of China, the President may issue an Executive order suspending the application of section 5721(a) of this title to such law or provision of law. And 22 USC 5721(a) says: (a) In general Notwithstanding any change in the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, the laws of the United States shall continue to apply with respect to Hong Kong, on and after July 1, 1997, in the same manner as the laws of the United States were applied with respect to Hong Kong before such date unless otherwise expressly provided by law or by Executive order under section 5722 of this title. It seems that 22 USC 5721(a) just says that US laws will apply to Hong Kong after the handover to China the same way they did before the handover (when it was a colony of the UK), and this executive order, in suspending the application of 22 USC 5721(a), just applies US laws based on the situation now rather than as of June 30, 1997. But it seems to me that this would only matter if the law in question treated Hong Kong differently between when it was a British colony and when it is a Chinese SAR. From reading the text of section 103 of the Immigration Act of 1990, it seems to make no distinction between Hong Kong before the handover and after the handover. It doesn't say that Hong Kong will only be treated as a separate country of chargeability up to June 30, 1997, nor that it only applied while Hong Kong was a British colony. It seems to provide for Hong Kong to continue to be treated as a separate country of chargeability regardless of what country governs it or what administrative status it has. I fail to see how the discontinuation of application of 22 USC 5721(a) affects this. So my questions are: Does this executive order cause people born in Hong Kong to be chargeable to China, or are they still chargeable to the separate country of \"Hong Kong\"? If the answer to #1 is that Hong Kong is still a separate country of chargeability, then what was the point of including section 103 of the Immigration Act of 1990 in the executive order? If the answer to #1 is that Hong Kong is still a separate country of chargeability, does the US executive branch have the power to, through any other means, make people born in Hong Kong chargeable to China, without a new Act of Congress? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Are people born in Hong Kong now chargeable to Mainland China for US immigration purposes?"}

I was called into a \"roommate meeting\" which was mostly to steamroll me with a rehearsed lecture on the dangers of Herpes (something I've had for 9 years, and only get my information on directly from doctors and doctor approved websites), and threaten to sue me twice for not disclosing I had it before we signed on the lease together, because we share food. Clearly seeing she has little to no basic understand of how common and non-life affecting Herpes is (besides the obvious stigma) I tried to explain that's not how it works, and her level of anger escalated, so I left. Since then, I just haven't spoken to her, choosing to let her cool off on her own time, but instead she has taken to harassing me, moving my things into my room whenever I'm not home, using things then piling them in front of my bedroom door, etc. Came home a couple of nights ago to everything of mine she doesn't use outside of my room piled up against the door barricading me out. She had slipped a packet on HSV-2 under the door (which I am certain she didn't read, because I think it would have made her feel a lot better about it, and realize she, too, carries at least one strain). It is beyond clear by now that she is trying to push me to feeling so uncomfortable at home that I'll move out, and I'm feeling so at a loss of what to do about it. Is there anything I can even legally do against a roommate who is super clearly discriminating against me for having HSV-2? Several friends have suggested a restraining order, and I AM starting to look for somewhere else, but in the mean time, I don't know how I'll get out of my lease, or feel safe at home. \nTITLE: ", "output": "I'm being discriminated against by my roommate, can I legally do anything about it?"}

The states have been granted in several court cases even up to the supreme court. The state has the power to regulate interstate, and intrastate transportation, and commerce. So when it comes to people saying that they have the right to travel, we can all agree that they have this right guaranteed in the constitution. However, the problem comes along when they try and say that they have the right to operate, or drive a motor vehicle. Initially, I thought that this was a ridiculous and frivolous argument, until someone asked me to define the following terms. transportation motor vehicle vehicle drive owner operate In standard English, we all know exactly what the law states, and what the courts have decided. However, when using the LEGAL definition of these words. I do see an argument. That argument being that all of these words' legal definition refer to commerce, and that none of these words actually apply to the individual not engaged in commerce. The question I'm trying to understand is if the common-law right to travel can be applied to a person driving a car, or rather I guess the statement would be made that the transportation code does not apply to individual citizens who are not actively engaging in commerce. , but with the definitions coming from U.S. statutes, case law and blacks TRANSPORTATION CODE TITLE 7.

Two months ago, he was unfortunately caught for excessive speeding. Both his car and his driving license were confiscated immediately. By law (SVG Art 16c, Abs 2 a_bis and Art 90) he now expects a jail sentence of at least one year. But since this was the first incident of this kind, he will probably get away with a suspended sentence. Today is his trial.

Can the judge, based on the second incident, change his sentence because he now knows that the suspended sentence probably won't hold Bob from speeding? The judge of course knows that there will likely be a second trial involving Bob (for speeding again, but also for stealing a car and driving without a license).

In general, I understand I can't use art from a copyrighted video game for my own commercial purposes. On the top left, I mark the Mario artwork with an X to mark that the work is copyright of Nintendo. \u2014 Cropping the image to a 3-color 6x6 block is still recognizably Mario, so I believe the small block in the bottom left is still under their copyright. In the top center, I mark that color changes have no impact on the copyright status. Nintendo owns copyright over the patterns themselves. \u2014 I even assume the cropped one-bit image of 4x5 pixels showing part of a color-swapped Mario's face as under Nintendo copyright because it is arguably still recognizably Mario. For the third example, I assume that Nintendo still has at least some rights over a derivative work heavily influenced by Mario. The derived 'mario' is wearing a jersey instead of overalls and facing forward. \u2014 In this case, however, I don't believe Nintendo has any grounds for a copyright claim over the derived and cropped one-bit 4x5 image of a face. This little face, while it shares some pixels with the original Mario- is no longer recognizably Mario, so I mark it with a green check mark. Finally, to the question- is there a point where cropping without derivation is sufficient grounds to be considered my own copyrightable work? Look at the three business cards on the very right of the image. They all crop elements directly from the color-swapped Mario Sprite, but I've been told they are not recognizably Mario. Would Nintendo have grounds to sue me were I to begin to profit off plumbing, insurance, or my own racing team based on the three fictional companies on the far right? What are the standards by which these decisions are made? I'm going off the assumption it's recognizability. What else could it be?

This happens for example for US companies such as oDesk or Udemy which pay non-US persons remotely. Field nr. 2 in that form requires the \"Country of Citizenship\". According to the IRS instructions here it's not clear whether you should enter your country of citizenship or your country of residence in case you don't reside in your country of citizenship: Line 2. Enter your country of citizenship. If you are a dual citizen, enter the country where you are both a citizen and a resident at the time you complete this form. If you are not a resident in any country in which you have citizenship, enter the country where you were most recently a resident. However, if you are a U. S. citizen, you should not complete this form even if you hold citizenship in another jurisdiction. Instead, provide Form W-9. This line is not clear to me: \"If you are not a resident in any country in which you have citizenship, enter the country where you were most recently a resident.\" Is the above \"if\" statement contingent of the previous \"if\" statement which states that \"If you are a dual citizen, enter the country where you are both a citizen and a resident at the time you complete this form\"? In other words, should you enter in \"Country of Citizenship\" your residence country only in the case of dual-citizenship or also in the case of simply not being a resident in your country of citizenship?

The employee or the employer? As a trivial example, let's say the employee were a senior citizen. Furthermore, let's say that the employer has booked hotel rooms for a conference stay, and that that hotel offers a senior discount in the final booking price. In this case, it's straightforward to see that the company made a smart economic choice to get the most bang for the buck. These savings are the company's. But what if, unbeknownst to the company, the hotel offers freebies of economic value to all senior citizens. Something like a day at the spa, or a gift certificate for a future stay. The company's choice was not motivated by the free gift, and so the company received full value for its money. In the above case: the employee would not have received the freebie without the company's money but neither would the employee have qualified for the freebie without the employee's non-work-related status (i.e. age). So they've both contributed something. Without each one's unique contribution, the new value would not have been unlocked. So who \"owns\" the freebie? Is the value all the company's? It paid the money. Is the value all the employee's? The gift was given to the individual, for qualifying reasons which are wholly unrelated to their employment. Is the value to be equally shared between the two? If so, is there precedent for how to split this value? (Let's pretend that the value were high enough for both the employer and the employee to care) P.S. I think this is different from the question of frequent flier miles. It is well-established that the employer owns FF miles. IANAL so my opinion is on shaky ground, but I see some daylight between the above and FF miles. FF miles are given to anyone who has an account, and are part of standard carriage for all travelers. Anyone can sign up for an FF program.

The company's software is marketed to law enforcement officials, but the database is filled with publicly-available data scraped from sites like Facebook, Twitter, etc. Concerns are growing that the database could infringe upon personal freedoms, specifically the right to privacy when used in conjunction with state-of-the-art mathematical facial recognition algorithms recently published. I agree with those sentiments, this technology is dangerous. Now Forbes has reported on it as well and affirmed those beliefs, highlighting the Clearview AI privacy policy's horrible stipulation for obtaining your own personal data that they have collected: Contact information If you would like to ask a question about our privacy policy or exercise your data privacy rights please contact us at: privacy-requests@clearview.ai.

In order to know what they've collected on us, we have to give them a government-issued ID??

I would like to know whether a similar principle is either codified or known as a common principle in the interpretation of laws in Germany. On the one hand, the rule sounds like a sane basis for interpreting a text that is not accompanied by explicit definitions. On the other hand, the Wikipedia article is not linked to any German equivalent (for what it's worth, it is not linked to any equivalent in any other language). Also, cases come to mind where German courts did not seem to apply an \"ordinary meaning\"1. It is well possible, however, that such cases are exceptions (that became well-known precisely due to their exceptional character) rather than the \"normal procedure\". If this concept does exist in German law, is there any specific term normally used to refer to this concept? 1: I mean instances like the infamous ruling on the duration of military service vs. alternative civilian service. \"The duration of X must not exceed the duration of Y.\" was interpreted in such a way that \"duration\" refers to the effort/stress level, which must be equal, while X may very well last for a longer time than Y.

Recently, I've been receiving calls from Conserve, a company that provides private and confidential services to private and public companies (as stated by the agent on the phone). This immediately made me suspicious, and when I asked for more information, they simply stated that they could not give me any more information. I told them that the person they were looking for was not available, and they stated that they would call back later. Before I could tell them not to, they had hung up. I looked up the company, and found that they are a debt collection agency, and on their website, it states that This communication is from a debt collector, and is an attempt to collect a debt. Any information obtained will be used for that purpose. As far as I am aware, if it is a debt collection agency calling, don't they have to inform of this, before I tell them any information? There is not automated message that states this, and it is from a different number each day. The reason I am certain that it is a debt collection agency calling, is because the person that they are looking for, has told me about debts that they have, and have received letters attempting to collect a debt.

As a thought I have had for sometime, and then later brought to light by other people like in this article, it is not possible to actually touch anything or anyone. The sensation of touch is fulfilled essentially by electrons repelling where the waves pass through. Given this is the case, there are many laws which do not have a clear definition of what touch actually consists of, instead focusing more on the action and implied state of matter making contact with matter (which is not possible) and what matter can be (an object, person, etc.). Given that touch is not possible except under the theory of nuclear fusion where the state of an atom is fused with another atom both requiring an enormous amount of energy of an inconvenienced amount, and releasing under the theory, an unending source of energy, it is safe to say that this doesn't happen in (for example) a fist fight (even though the participants may feel like it had]).

Customer sets up alerts, and relies on them to know when to make a payment. Bank fails to send them, resulting in late payments and credit damage. Is the issuer liable? Common law negligence and negligent misrepresentation causes of action typically involve a \"duty of care\". Does a duty of care arise under these circumstances, i.e., from the fact that the issuer advertised the feature? The cardmember agreement does not reference account alerts at all. @Rock Ape kindly points out that a supplementary agreement may. One does (pertinent parts below). Three parts stick out: No express promise is made that messages will be sent at all, only that the agreement \"includes access\" to \"Alerts\". However, one could argue that it is implied. It contains a sentence limiting liability from \"any disclosure of account information to third parties, non-delivery, delayed delivery, misdirected delivery or mishandling of, or inaccurate content in, the messages sent\". Based on the context, my interpretation is that the limitation is for third-party conduct (e.g. customer's e-mail provider fails to deliver alert). Alerts are \"provided for your convenience and do not replace your monthly account statement(s), which are the official record of your accounts\".

As noted in the article, there have been a number of convictions for vicarious abuse. Of course, there are other reasons why some people might hurt their children, such as part of a pattern of abuse toward the children unrelated to spousal abuse, for the purpose of collecting life insurance money, as part of sexual abuse, and so forth, so presumably there exist certain criteria in the Spanish legal system to distinguish these cases.

The transaction involved is literally purchasing receivables and, for accounting purposes, the payables are classified as trade debt and not financial debt. Invoice factoring (and other variations of this scheme such as supply chain finance) is used as a form of financing for suppliers to get cash in advance and for buyers to get better payment terms. Understandably, in many countries factoring companies would be required some financial service license in order to operate business. For instance, in Singapore they would need a moneylender's license unless they are already in possess of a banking license. Question: In general, would a firm need some license to factor international invoices? Sure it's a form of financing, but the operation involved is literally purchasing invoices... Would the factor need some financial service license in the country where the invoice is issued to? Or maybe some import/trade license in the country where the invoice is issued to? Or... ? To make it all more clear, think of this example: I am a factor based in Singapore, and I am purchasing invoices issued by a supplier in Thailand to a buyer in Indonesia. If all these countries have annoyingly stringent regulations, I'm guessing I might need some business license (maybe for import/export) in Thailand, and some moneylending license in Indonesia. But do I need any license at all?

The part of the plot I'm interested in is: Daniel \"Dan\" Gallagher is a successful, happily-married Manhattan lawyer whose work leads him to meet Alexandra \"Alex\" Forrest, an editor for a publishing company. While his wife, Beth, and daughter, Ellen, are out of town for the weekend, Dan has an affair with Alex. Although it was initially understood by both as just a fling, Alex begins to cling to him. After leaving unexpectedly in the middle of the night, Dan reluctantly spends the following day with Alex after she persistently asks him over. When Dan attempts to suddenly leave again, she cuts her wrists in a manipulative ploy to force him to stay. He helps her bandage the cuts, stays with her overnight to make sure she is all right, and leaves in the morning. Although Dan believes the affair to be forgotten, Alex shows up at his office one day to apologize for her behavior and invites him to a performance of Madame Butterfly, but he politely turns her down. She then continues to call him at his office until he tells his secretary that he will no longer take her calls. Alex then phones his home at all hours, claiming that she is pregnant and plans to keep the baby. Although he wants nothing to do with her, she argues that he must take responsibility. After he changes his home phone number, she shows up at his apartment (which is for sale) and meets Beth, feigning interest as a buyer. Later that night, Dan goes to Alex's apartment to confront her, which results in a scuffle. In response, she replies that she will not be ignored. Dan moves his family to Bedford, but this does not deter Alex. She has a tape recording delivered to him filled with verbal abuse. She stalks him in a parking garage, pours acid onto his car, ruining the engine, and follows him home one night to spy on him, Beth, and Ellen from the bushes in their yard: the sight of the family makes her sick to her stomach. Her obsession escalates further when Dan approaches the police to apply for a restraining order against Alex (claiming that it is \"for a client\"). The lieutenant claims that he cannot violate her rights without probable cause, and that the \"client\" has to own up to his adultery. I highlight the relevant part. It's surprising to me that Dan, who's obviously being harassed, cannot get a restraining order against Alex. Is the lieutenant correct when he says he cannot authorize a restraining order because it would violate Alex's rights, unless Dan admits to adultery? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Is the plot of Fatal Attraction legally accurate?"}

He addresses people who have claimed there was no testing. That got me curious about the process so I did some research. Looking to fill in some gaps. Could the new mRNA vaccines have come to market without any testing? I keep hearing claims that the new Covid vaccines weren't tested before being brought to market, and that there's a law eliminating all liability, both criminal and civil, in the emergency situation. Lacking legal incentives to test, Pfizer, Moderna, and the rest did not, so it is claimed. My own research suggests otherwise, perhaps on a technicality, but I'm no lawyer. Best I can tell, limited liability for vaccine manufacturers comes from the 2005 law PREPA. It still allows for prosecuting \"willful misconduct\". Am I right to take that to mean criminal liability is still on the table? From what I can tell, an effort is made to rein in what qualifies as \"willful misconduct\" which could potentially reduce even criminal liability to nothing. It's also been said that those potentially hurt by an emergency vaccine have no recourse when injured. From what I can tell, they may have no legal recourse but VICP and CICP of The Healthcare Systems Bureau will compensate people. This happens rarely and with a pittance, so arguably doesn't exist.

Something easy to prove and in fact I invited them to check in internet, were you find that we don\u2019t receive more than 30 pounds a year. So, I said I would paid something, from my own pocket. They haven\u2019t reply yet, but I have been doing a research and talking to colleagues and press associations. And there is a consensus: Copyrigth is a legal company but doesn\u2019t act ethically, they act as scam and there are many complains. Plus I found this: \u201cIn view of German copyright law and the respective jurisdiction of the German courts, the amount that Copytrack claims is far too high\u201d. The amounts they usually charge are absurd. For instance, if a photo cost 30 Euros or 100 Euros, Copytrack asks for 500, 600, 1000 euros and more. We think this is because they don\u2019t charge for their services to their clients, so the way to get their fees is by doing this. I am are aware copyright infringement is something serious and we respect other people\u2019s work, but I want all this managed in a fair, ethical and reasonable manner from both sides. I have been asking for advice and my colleagues say, I must ignore it. But like @user1889580 , I am worried. I am ready to pay, but to be honest the blog doesn\u2019t have money and me either, so I I have asked for a symbolic fee or for the minimum amount. I am still checking and doing some research but I would appreciate your advice. \nTITLE: ", "output": "How to negotiate a payment for copyright infringement?"}

There are different ways to become a British citizen. The most common is called \u2018naturalisation\u2019. You can apply for British citizenship by naturalisation if: you\u2019re 18 or over you\u2019re of good character, eg you don\u2019t have a serious or recent criminal record, and you haven\u2019t tried to deceive the Home Office or been involved in immigration offences in the last 10 years you\u2019ll continue to live in the UK you\u2019ve met the knowledge of English and life in the UK requirements you meet the residency requirement And you must usually have: lived in the UK for at least the 5 years before the date of your application spent no more than 450 days outside the UK during those 5 years spent no more than 90 days outside the UK in the last 12 months been granted indefinite leave to stay in the UK (or permanent residence if you\u2019re an EEA national) - this means there\u2019s no specific date that you have to leave had indefinite leave to stay in the UK for the last 12 months (or permanent residence if you\u2019re an EEA national) not broken any immigration laws while in the UK Since citizenship application fee is hefty (~\u00a31k) I figured to apply using NCS service.

They came into the building we were in, found us, and we exchanged insurance and contact information. I called my insurance, which ultimately had me call their insurance to file this claim. Apparently, when I called their insurance, they were already notified and had a claim started. As we walked through the steps to get the damage taken care of, we got onto the subject of rental vehicles since they were going to provide one as I was entirely not at fault. They stated that they'd only cover a mid-size four-door sedan unless there were accommodations that needed to be met. My immediate confusion/concern was that they damaged my full-size sedan, which is expected to be out for 3-4 days, but that they were essentially downgrading my daily transportation to save on costs. Question: Would I have any ground to push back and request a full-size sedan since that's the type of car they damaged? The only major thing that comes to my mind is an accommodation for my height. I'm 6'5\" (198cm~), so I'd expect that the vehicle should have a comfortable amount of room for me to sit up; and, even more important, not be so compact that my legs cannot drive comfortably.

Isn\u2019t the UK Government breaking the law? I am very worried and distressed at the idea of having my name and personal details in such register. With this scheme, is the UK Government responsible for the harm and distress caused to the individual health and mental wellbeing? Is there any ground for challenging this scheme legality in court?

That license is now no longer available, the page only stating 'retired'. What is the status of using a ribbon UI on Windows or any other platform? Is Microsoft still asserting IP rights, and is a license required? Note that there are many questions online about this, but no answer, much less a sourced one stating Microsoft's official position. This leaves many developers in a state of uncertainty. As of 2017: No documentation on MSDN anywhere mentions a license. Consider, for example, the MFC ribbon overview. The VC++ 2017 MFC CMFCRibbonBar class, the only ribbon installed with VS2017, links to the retired license in its header. This header has not changed for many years. Its documentation does not mention a license. The Visual Studio 2017 license does not mention the ribbon. The Windows 10 SDK license does not mention the ribbon (checked against 10.0.15603.137, downloaded 2017-04-11.) Some believe this means no-one who did not sign a license before it was retired are able to legally use a ribbon. A 2009 comment in a forum (not a good basis) states there are \"no unusual licensing requirements\". There has been no statement by Microsoft of a change in its attitude the the ribbon, arguably meaning that now a license is no longer available, no developers can use a ribbon. Microsoft uses a ribbon in its macOS Office applications, but has not indicated if other developers may use a ribbon on non-Windows platforms There is significant doubt if the ribbon is valid IP. This leaves all developers who did not sign a license prior to it being retired in limbo and uncertainty, not knowing: If they can use the inbuilt WinAPI ribbon control on Windows 10 without a license If they can use a third party ribbon control on Windows without a license If they can use a third party ribbon control on macOS or Linux If they can use a ribbon for an application that competes with a Microsoft application (either Office, or other.)

It should not be used to simply gain compliance with instructions or procedures where compliance is not linked to such a threat There was a case in the news earlier this year where they seem to have been used outside this situation. It is described so, by the 80 year old target of the taser who was awaken by the officers, and was in his pajamas: \u201cAt least four fully-dressed police officers carrying machine guns shone dazzling flashlights in my face, all shouting and shouting something unintelligible at me. They gave me no instructions, nothing. \u201cSuddenly one of them fired this Taser at me and the electricity started to zap. It hit me in the stomach and upper leg and I fell on the kitchen floor, powerless. \u201cThen they jumped on me, knelt on my back to pin me to the tiled floor, twisted my arms behind my back, handcuffed me and told me I was under arrest for a fight.\u201d This sounds completely contrary to the statements above. Is there any criminal law that restricts police Taser use?

(I realize this feels adversarial, but I had a valid reason.) He replied that no, it was hospital policy that encounters could not recorded, and even after explaining the reason, he refused, so I did not. But I do wonder if this is legal. When I got home, I looked it up. According to this digital media law site, it is not illegal to record a conversation if you are one of the parties: Federal law permits recording telephone calls and in-person conversations with the consent of at least one of the parties. This is called a \"one-party consent\" law. Under a one-party consent law, you can record a phone call or conversation so long as you are a party to the conversation. I also saw that Pennsylvania's wiretapping law is a \"two-party consent\" law. I tried to read the wiretapping law but gave up pretty quickly. So I'm left to wonder. Is it legal to prohibit recording a conversation in Pennsylvania? I have never been threatened with a lawsuit, so I'm a bit less leery of patients suing me than some of my colleagues. Granted it doesn't happen often, but I've always given consent when asked if I could be audio recorded (I'm a physician.) My reasoning: - It may be helpful to a caregiver who was unable to attend the visit. - It is no different than bringing in a friend or relative into the room (It's actually a lot more objective and I only have to answer one person's questions.) - Due to anxiety over illness, etc., patients only hear/remember about 25% of what a doctor says. An audio recording is a valuable resource for the patient if they want to review instructions or explanations they might have missed. - It empowers a patient to a small extent, evening out the huge imbalance of power between physician and patient. Anything I can do to increase confidence in me in particular, and in the medical profession in general, is a plus. - The patient has as much a right to an audio copy of our interaction as a paper copy of the chart. - I have nothing to hide if I'm doing my best and meeting (hopefully exceeding) the standard of care. - It protects me as well if a claim is made (I imagine alteration of audio recordings can be detected if necessary. My previous malpractice carrier encouraged transparency in all things, and had no problems with this. But I never even thought to run this by the legal department of the hospital where I'm now employed, and if it's discouraged, I missed the memo. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Is it legal to *prohibit* recording a conversation in Pennsylvania?"}

Sometimes an institution obtains a license from the rights-holder which allows them to distribute copies in a specified way, subject to a set of conditions on X imposed on the end user. (I believe this is what \"sub-licensing\" refers to). The institution may err in its statement of the sub-license terms, for instance omitting a specification \"non-commercial use only\". In that case, the end user is misled as to what their actual legal relationship to the rights holder is: they have not been told that the software may not be used commercially, but permission was contingent on that restriction. The user also has no way to know what the license agreement is between the rights holder and the institution (except if the terms of that agreement are published). Using the software for a commercial purpose is thus not permitted, and the user has infringed on copyright. Although the user is innocent, they still did the act. As far as I know, the copyright statutes do not require any particular mental state for liability so there is no innocent infringement defense. 17 USC 504(c)(2) does allow mitigation of statutory damages: In a case where the infringer sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that such infringer was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright, the court in its discretion may reduce the award of statutory damages to a sum of not less than $200. The user might then sue the institution to recover that amount. However, a lot of law is written by the courts. So my questions are (1) is it correct that there is no statutory provision that makes such a user non-liable and (2) is there any case law that nevertheless makes an innocent infringement defense possible? Mainly I am asking about US law, but facts from other jurisdictions are also welcome. \nTITLE: ", "output": "What is your liability in case the terms of software license are mis-stated?"}

That means the host country ('s law enforcement) cannot enter the premises nor do anything inside. I assume that applies only without the consent of the head of the diplomatic mission, but is that right? My understanding of the arrest of Julian Assange in UK by bobbies given access by the Ecuador diplomats seems to go that way. What about the mission country's law enforcement? In the Agent 47 movie, US Marines make an arrest just in front of the building of the US embassy in Germany, so that seems like the mission country does have law enforcement power within the embassy grounds, but some other source than that not-so-realistic movie would be appreciated. Assuming point 2 is correct, and a suspect is arrested, what happens next? If the suspect were to be moved to the mission country's sovereign soil (which the embassy is not), would that country's laws allow them to be prosecuted, or would the court consider the act they committed to have been done in foreign sovereign territory ? Still assuming point 2 is correct, what would be the conditions for moving the suspect from the embassy (within the host country) to the mission country? can the host country forbid it? Finally, what happens if, say, a hostage-taking attack prevents anyone from the embassy to communicate the permission given in point 1, and the law enforcement capacities from point 2 (from the mission country) are not capable of responding (because they are incapacitated for example)? The most extreme legal response would be for the host country to revoke diplomatic credentials for the diplomatic mission, and to invade it with its own law enforcement after a given period of time. Is there another way? For example, can a mission-country diplomat (the minister for foreign affairs for example) provide a point-1 authorization from abroad, without consent from the ambassador?

How can B, who pretends to be C, be not B? Again \"B is not B\" doesn't make sense to me! I'm asking this separately because here, if I understood the boldened quote, B isn't necessarily pretending to be C. Mindy Chen-Wishart. Contract Law (2018 6 edn). p 262. 6.2.5 Non-existence of the identity assumed According to this rule, A\u2019s mistake as to B\u2019s identity will only void their contract if A mistook B for another existing and identifiable party, C. If A merely believes that B is C who is non-existent or unidentifiable, the contract is only voidable. In King\u2019s Norton Metal Co Ltd v Edridge, Merrett & Co Ltd (1897), K sent goods in response to an order from the fictitious \u2018Hallam & Co\u2019, written on headed stationery with a picture of a large factory and a list of overseas depots. The fraudster then sold the goods to E. Although the contract was in writing, the contract was only voidable for fraud because K intended to contract with the writer of the letter, being mistaken only as to his attributes; namely, solvency and respectability. The contract was not void for K\u2019s mistake that it was contracting with \u2018Hallam & Co\u2019 because \u2018Hallam & Co\u2019 was nonexistent. \u2018If it could have been shown that there was a separate entity called Hallam & Co . . . then the case might have come within the decision in Cundy v Lindsay.\u2019 It is difficult to see why A and D\u2019s rights should depend on whether A mistook B for another real entity or not. Furthermore, why was it not enough in King\u2019s Norton that K believed that \u2018Hallam & Co\u2019 existed, when it did not? This supposed rule is subject to two exceptions, which require impossible distinctions to be drawn: (i) A contract may be voided if A makes the additional mistake that C exists, even if C does not exist. But is there a meaningful difference between A believing \u2018B to be not B\u2019, and by implication someone else (contract not void); and A believing \u2018B to be C, mistakenly believing that C exists\u2019 (contract is void)? After all, in Lake v Simmons p 263. (1927), the mistress of a wealthy customer, a widower, purchased some items from L, and then persuaded L to let her take away valuable pearl necklaces for her \u2018husband\u2019s approval\u2019. L\u2019s loss was only insured if no valid contract was made with the mistress. The court so found, although she was posing as a non-existent wife. (ii) A contract is void when [1] A believes that B who pretends to be C is not B (whether C exists or not), [2] as long as there is an implied term that B is not B (Said v Butt (1920)), as where: \u2022 an offer is made only to persons fitting particular descriptions which excludes B (eg \u2018current students of a particular university\u2019, or being \u2018over 18 years\u2019 to buy alcohol); or \u2022 B may know from previous dealings that A is unwilling to contract with them (eg B is barred from a pub or a soccer match). If the rationale is merely that B cannot accept an offer known not to be meant for her, then why did this not apply in King\u2019s Norton Metal when the fraudster must have known that K had no intention of contracting with him? \nTITLE: ", "output": "\"as long as there is an implied term that B is not B\""}

The title should be legally relevant, capture key aspects of the issue, and entice readers to learn more. \nQUESTION: Background According to my textbook: In Cruikshank ... the [Supreme] Court ruled that voting rights remained a state prerogative unless the state itself violated those rights. So long as the civil rights of former slaves were being violated by individuals or private groups (including the Klan), that was a state responsibility and beyond federal jurisdiction. Therefore, the Fourteenth Amendment did not protect citizens from armed vigilantes, even if those vigilantes seized political power. The Court thus gutted the Fourteenth Amendment. (America, A Concise History) Emphasis mine. This does not make much sense to me. This decision is in the context of the (very violent) intimidation of blacks especially by ex-Confederates followed by a Democratic political coup. From what I understand, the Democrats disenfranchised African Americans. The Supreme Court then ruled that it was the state's responsibility to ensure that its citizen's rights were not infringed upon. First contention Firstly, why would it be the state's responsibility to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, which is part of the Constitution? The Fourteenth Amendment states, The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. (Section 5 of the 14th Amendment) Does this, not to mention that it is a Constitutional amendment, not imply that issues pertaining to the Fourteenth Amendment, such as equal access to voting (Section 2 of the 14th Amendment), are under federal jurisdiction? Second contention If \"private groups\" like the KKK took political power, would the governments that they became part of not be violating former slaves' civil rights (as opposed to just private individuals)? Therefore, it would be that state's duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to address the illegal actions of actors within its jurisdiction. However, if the state fails to address these actions, would it not then become the federal government's jurisdiction since the state failed to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment within its borders? Would the plaintiff have needed to sue the state for failing to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment in order for it to be under federal jurisdiction? Closing I am not very fluent in law things, so please excuse me for any misused vocabulary (like \"jurisdiction\"), nor do I have a thorough understanding of federal vs. state jurisdiction or Constitutional law. \nTITLE: ", "output": "U.S. v.

This chess set is usually used by small kids, 2-5 year old, who move the large chess pieces, make around themselves, pretend to ride the horses, etc. One day a much bigger kid, 10 year old or so, apparently elated by the lack of supervision, ran into that chess playground, and started throwing the 5 lbs chess pieces with force across the chess set in random directions, sometimes missing the toddlers by inches. The thrown pieces would sometime bump the other pieces around the toddlers, sometime miss a toddler's head or leg by inches, etc. This lasted for at least 5 min. And in those 5 min of quite dangerous bombardment not a single adult would attempt to restrain the minor. Some parents would take their toddlers out of the chess board games despite their protests; some would get closer to their kids within the chess board while watching the 10-yo, apparently with intent to intercept a chess piece if it would fly at their kid; some adults would just watch what's happening from the benches. And nobody would interfere with the apparently dangerous youth, not physically, and not even verbally. I gathered from the conversations nearby that the adults were just afraid to restrain the youth for the fear of being accused later that they were doing something illegal against the minor. The parents were more afraid to be branded abusers of that child than of the physical harm said child would do to their own kids. Thus the question: how realistic where their fears in the state of California? If an adult physically restrains a child and claims that the child was a danger to others can the adult have legal problems? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Can a Californian be in legal trouble for physically restraining a dangerous child not his own?"}

The Covid pandemic has put the face-to-face interview on hold, and the government doesn't seem interested in relaxing that requirement so his green card is delayed indefinitely. They both have passports, and with the marriage certificate have been able to cross the border to see each other periodically. However, the conventional wisdom they are adhering to is that he cannot apply for work in the US, and cannot stay longer than 6 months at a time, so they are choosing to live apart for now. (They are both living with parents and would probably need to combine incomes to maintain a comfortable standard of living) I wanted to help them consider options that just might allow for an interim solution to their woes. A quick search turned up that a K1 visa is available for Fianc\u00e9s of US citizens that would allow one to work. It also shows several other different categories of temporary work visas available. I am looking for work myself now, so I am getting pretty familiar with the type of questions employers ask. If \u201cUS Person\u201d status is not required they often ask if sponsorship is required to work. When my son in law first applied my daughter was a full time student and didn\u2019t have the income required to sponsor him. Therefore, I agreed to be his sponsor. I plan to continue researching, but was hoping that someone with more experience might have a suggestion that could point us in the right direction. Along those lines I have a few questions regarding the best, (fastest...) path forward so that they can move in and start a life together: Is the K1 visa even an option now, or are they beyond that point already? If not, is there another visa type available for spouses short of a green card? Is there anything legally preventing him from applying for, and accepting a job in the US right now? a. Might a written job offer give him to the status needed to obtain the required work visa to actually start working? b. Can he legally answer that he does not require a sponsor because I am his sponsor? Even if he is unable to find work, surely as the spouse of a US citizen he ought to be able to stay in the US for longer than six months pending final approval of permanent residence status.

Isn't it too disputable and vague?? Firstly, it wrongly assumes that the \"law\" on exclusion clauses is settled and certain. Perhaps the case law is uncertain. Or there may not even be law. Secondly, it wrongly assumes that \"the maximum extent\" can be handily identified. Perhaps Landlord and I disagree on what \"the maximum extent\" is. Thirdly, the \"law\" can change. Then what's \"the maximum extent\" or \"law\"? I communicated these arguments to the Leasing Manager, but she refused to amend this clause. She replied that this clause is part of Landlord's standard form contract, and Landlord almost never amends it for small business owners like me. Is this reasonable? Or must I just push harder? I'm bewildered because I don't want to antagonize Landlord by pushing harder, and I got little bargaining power. I plan to pay a solicitor to review the contract, but the solicitor advised me informally to ask the landlord myself to define the extent of the exclusion clause upfront. Why?

How can you admit negligence as a form of fault, without broadening the traditional category of mens rea? Ashworth's Principles of Criminal Law (2020 9 edn). p 207. The argument is therefore moving towards the conclusion that negligence may be an appropriate standard for criminal liability where: (a) the (potential) harm is great; (b) the risk of it occurring is obvious; (c) D has a duty to try to avoid the risk; and (d) D has the capacity to take the required precautions. This opens up further debates on various points. The thesis is that negligence may be an appropriate standard where there are well-known risks of serious harm. This argues in favour of negligence as a standard of liability for certain serious offences against the person, including some serious sexual offences,279 and also for some serious offences against the environment and property. But it must be debated whether liability for serious crime should be confined to gross negligence, not simple negligence. And it would be vital to protect \u2018rule of law\u2019 expectations, and thus to ensure that people receive fair warning of any duties that may form the basis of criminal negligence liability.280 The spread of negligence liability would not have to result in the broadening of the traditional category of mens rea: negligence could be admitted as a form of fault, whereas intention and recklessness would remain the two forms of mens rea. It would be perfectly possible for a criminal code to provide separate crimes of negligence, with lower maximum sentences, at appropriate points in the hierarchy of offences. A further issue is whether the offences of negligence should be in the inchoate mode\u2014\u2018failing to take reasonable precautions\u2019\u2014or should be tied to the occurrence of the particular harm. Careless driving is of the former type, manslaughter of the latter.281 Fault is related to mens rea. I quote pp 174-175. (a) Mens rea and fault It has already been argued that there should be no criminal liability without fault for imprisonable offence.109 Indeed, there is a respectable argument for saying that there should never be criminal liability without fault;110 but whilst that view seems persuasive in relation to the liability of individuals, it is perhaps less persuasive where the liability of businesses is concerned, particularly in cases where there is a defence to the crime in question of \u2018due diligence shown\u2019 (or the like). The claim that criminal offences should include mens rea\u2014guilty mind\u2014requirements reflects the view that criminal liability should be imposed only on persons who can be said \u2018subjectively\u2019 to have associated themselves through their behaviour with the p 175 wrongful conduct in question (including the circumstance or consequence elements of the offence, if any). In broad terms, this occurs when people engage in wrongful conduct intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, whilst possessing similar mental states such as indifference, awareness, or suspicion, or when they are complicit in the wrongdoing of others. The subjective mens rea approach encompasses the belief principle, which holds that criminal liability should be based on what defendants believed they were doing or risking, not on facts which were unknown to them at the time.111 For example, according to the belief principle, if D is found in possession of class A drugs, but claims he believed he was in possession of class B drugs, if the prosecution cannot prove otherwise he should be acquitted of \u2018possessing class A drugs\u2019. It should not be sufficient to show that he knew he was in possession of prohibited drugs unless, of course, as under the present law, there is a specific offence of possessing \u2018a prohibited drug\u2019.112 \nTITLE: ", "output": "If negligence is admitted as a form of fault, how aren't you broadening the traditional category of mens rea?"}

The website has users from around the world. All articles have to be approved by an editor, although the website can have articles with opposite viewpoints. This site also allows comments to be made, however, the comments are not sanitized in the server (which is essentially security 101), so javascript code and external scripts, and style can be included in the comments and executed by any user when loaded. This means that any user can effectively change the contents of the articles, headlines, or any text/links/images in the webpage. This means that an article could be turned into an attack piece against a politician or controversial CEO when it was actually about something else, and it would appear that the original author wrote that. Comments can also be changed as well. This means that one comment could be used to insert a script that promoted fake news (like stock market manipulation - \"Elon Musk arrested by the FBI or operating a $10b cocaine ring\" / \"Company A's study is a failure\" / \"Trudeau on the run from RCMP for embezzlement of $2B.\"). A script is able to obtain the name of any user who visits the page, their location (through IP or browser geolocation - on phones it can get the exact address), is able to keylog, and can effectively stay in the background even if the user goes to a different page. It would be possible for an external script to screenshot the browser window, track what pages are visited, and the script could replace payment processing forms with it's own forms, effectively being able to steal credit card information. There's also several social engineering exploits that would be possible like a fake LastPass login popup (to steal credentials/credit cards saved with it) or fake notifications (that can be used to download malware).

The critics of those laws regard them as undemocratic. Their proponents claim that they cannot be undemocratic because most of these laws were copied from American ones, the United States is the most democratic country in the world, hence, by doing the same thing the US does, Russia gets closer to the American democratic ideal.

Their mere presence is not a threat or assault of course, but if they are attempting to deter someone from acting in negative manner the security personnel would likely have to get close to the person and make demands that they leave or stop whatever activity their engaged in in a manner that could be considered a threat of force if they don't comply. To go with a particular difficult example think of a bouncer at a bar. More then most security personnel a bouncers job is practically defined by their ability to loom. My father owned a bar, and as he described it to me a good bouncer should be identifying someone who's likely to cause an incident and basically pre-emptively start looming nearby them to remind the inebriated fellow that the bouncer is ready to use physical force if necessary in hopes of preventing a situation from occurring. Likewise breaking up a minor fight often involves a good amount of getting between the two fighting and looking menacing enough that no one want's to try to go around you. Basically you want your bouncer to be able to menace people when a situation is escalating because it's a far safer way of preventing the escalation then allowing it to degreed to violence. Is a bouncer, or other security individual, guilty of assault or related crime when they do something like this? Does the fact that they are employed by a business with the explicit task of keeping the peace give them any extra leeway with such actions? Is the fact that they are trying to prevent/discourage other crimes give them more leeway? \nTITLE: ", "output": "How can civilian security personnel do their jobs without risk of committing assault or related crimes?"}

In War Games the quote \"The only way to win is to not play the game\" (let a father judge another father) is for an end game solution, but if someone is being coerced to try to hurt the other person (i.e. restraining order), and the other person can convince the judge that they're being forced into something can a judge choose to extend spousal immunity to the couple if they're communicating by lying on the stand as a \"smoke screen\"? What happens if someone is made aware of the fact the person is mentally incompetent after the trial is over, and the transcript gets lost?

It was discussed, amongst other things, how Hilton has had many 'firsts', including first hotel room TV, first room service, first pi\u00f1a colada etc. One of the things Nassetta claimed Hilton invented is the chocolate brownie - first baked by one of the chefs at Chicago's Palmer House Hilton. Looking at the wikipedia page for the Chocolate Brownie, this seems to check out: \"Bertha Palmer, a prominent Chicago socialite whose husband owned the Palmer House Hotel. In 1893 Palmer asked a pastry chef for a dessert suitable for ladies attending the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition. She requested a cake-like confection smaller than a piece of cake that could be included in boxed lunches. The result was the Palmer House Brownie with walnuts and an apricot glaze.\" However, a quick read of the Wikipedia page for the hotel, we find that this Hotel did not become part of the Hilton chain until 1945, 52 years after the brownie was invented. \"In December 1945, Conrad Hilton bought the Palmer House for $20 million and it was thereafter known as The Palmer House Hilton.

That person engages in some legal procedure in a fraudulant (and possibly criminal) way, to obtain recognition of expanded rights (e.g. can use objects more extensively, entitled to larger part of future profits or ownership etc.) The person is found by a court to have engaged in said wrongful acts or behavior. The court not only strips the person of the excess or additional rights they had tried to secure, but prevents or limits that person from realizing even the rights they had initially had grounds to realize.

I am most interested in such scenarios in Common Law systems, despite the fact that the adage in the title is Latin; other systems are also relevant, altough a bit less so.

Because of my 30+ years of professional IT services, he also asked me to do a variety of IT-related services for him already before he hired me for the financial services. In the past, these were rather small things (e.g., setting up a newsletter), and he always paid my invoices promptly without question. Sometimes we would agree on an amount upfront and mostly we did not - he trusted me, and I trusted him. This month, he asked me to simplify an Excel sheet with a large number of columns which was very difficult for him to navigate. I created a proof of concept for him which he again paid promptly. We reviewed the POC together to verify that I was going in the direction he wanted. When he confirmed that, I said that finalizing this app (which it turned out to be) will be a lot more work. He said that's fine and did not ask any further questions. Since we saw each other almost every day, I kept him in the loop about me working on the app, that I spent a significant amount of time already, and that there is a lot more to do. He always responded with \"that's fine\". In fact, he liked what I had done as POC so much that he said later that he had reached out to the patent office for filing copyright. There was never any agreement on transfer of intellectual property. Last Thursday I sent him another invoice since we had reached a milestone close to completion. He said this invoice was too high, and that he would not pay it. He would be willing to pay \"what's fair\" but not this. And he wanted me to adust the invoice to a lower amount. Sidenote: since he did not make any attempt from his end to reach any kind of resolution I ended the working relationship this Monday. He now claims that he does not owe me anything. If I remove his access to the app (it's a Google file) does he then have the right to not pay the invoice and I have waived my right to receive payment? Is the transfer of intellectual property automatically assumed? Is there any way for me to veto his copyright registration?

They are also a naturalized citizen, who is white, but is of a minority ethnic group (for background). The org has sent out several emails over time focusing on racism, but with the implication that white people are the sole problem of all racism. (which, let me be clear, here in the US, there is of course centuries of legitimate beef!) The issue being that they are receiving these messages and feel insulted and as if they're being disparaged by the company itself, solely for their race. This person is open minded and believes that there are issues with equality in the country, but receives these emails and believes from time to time that they are being told that all white people are a problem, rather than focusing on issues with inclusivity and equality or racism in general, just very specifically focusing on white people. They recently received a company wide meeting invite for a meeting discussing the concept of whiteness and how it impacts an organization and individuals, going on to liken \"whiteness\" itself to white supremacy. My friend wrote a response, asking not to be included on future meeting invites, explaining that the one in question and others have made it feel as though their 'whiteness' was a problem, and that they felt it was a pejorative term and would like to not receive remarks like this in the future. The business later sent another email that includes some description of the meeting itself, that it is sent to an organization wide distribution list and will not have an ability for people to opt out (therefore, my interpretation being, they are ignoring their request to stop receiving the offensive remarks in these emails into the future). It goes on to state that the next session will be on White Fragility, and states that \"by definition\", racism is based on the concept of whiteness, which is enforced by power and violence. It has a definition of 'white fragility' later on that paired with the usage of the term in the email seems somewhat offensive... in the same way that hearing 'black fragility' or other combinations of the words would seem, from the negative connotations of the word fragility, of course pejorative to whatever group is paired with it. My question is... This seems like a form of harassment and discrimination. Is it? Are there additional steps they should take to address the issue? I've told my friend they need to find a lawyer and consider whether they have a case, as they'd included HR and their own manager, as well as the other person who's sending these messages, and are still receiving them. They've told me messages like these have been going out for years and it's been very upsetting having to read them and having to confront them specifically in order to request that they stop receiving them... just to have it continue. They are, of course, very worried they'll lose their job over speaking up over it. **Are religious organizations allowed to discriminate based on race, is this a moot point?** I've seen references on the internet that the supreme court has ruled that religious org's can discriminate based on religion, but I haven't seen on race, such as in Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v.

The people however, do own the roads, as their money was used to construct them, pay for the workers to build them, and paid for the equipment and materials used in their construction, so by right and title, the people are trhe owners of the roads we use, as as property owners, we DO have the right to make use of them as we see fit, the state holds no deed, title or lease on our property. In fact, even the state, is the sole property of the people. Please tell us when we silently transferred our rights into privileges to bew controlled by the state, without consent or law? When and where, did the state decide on its own, that the roads we paid to have built, fell under its sole control and administration? This appears to be a clear case of theft of property without due process. The state does not automatically gain ownership or control of property it never held legal title to, and again, being a non-entity(person), the state can not own anything, as all property is owned by the people, not the state, which it too, iks the sole property of the people, and not self-created.

I moved in to a room in a shared house, and lived there for two weeks. I found it using a university accommodation portal for summer visitors. On the portal it was stated the house would be filled with other students at the university (which makes sense, because only summer visitors of the university are given access to the housing portal). The landlord's son, however, also lives in the house. About one week in, he gave me a copy of his autobiography. This autobiography details his battle with severe mental illness.

This fact alone might be enough to get me to move out of the house. But furthermore, he only gave his book to me and none of the other tenants, after knowing me for only a couple of days. I would not move out of the house if there were no strong indicators of past or potential for future violence in this book. I moved out, and the landlord sent me an e-mail saying I am still responsible for one month of rent, per the short term tenancy agreement (which I did sign).

Ann starts a company that grows to over 25 employees, at which point the company must follow EEOC regulations, which include nondiscrimination on the basis of religion. Then let's say a different Christian, Christine, applies for a job at Ann's company.

When Ann sees this past experience on Christine's resume, she immediately excludes Christine from consideration for employment. If Christine wanted to sue Ann's company, would she have a case? Let's assume that Ann gave written evidence to Christine that she was excluded because of her past religious work - clearly, few employers would be stupid enough to do this, but let's grant that assumption for the purposes of this question.

The Claimant commenced action in Newmarket. The Defendant carries on business [I skip address for privacy] Markham, Ontario. The correct jurisdiction is Richmond Hill.

A gas line has been installed across my property, to service the house. I have NO utility easements filed except for an original electric easement on the border. I installed my own electrical buried cable to service the house from a bordering transformer and meter. I let a different utility company install a gas line (because it seemed easier than DIY-ing with a meter at the street). I did sign an installation agreement with this written in the fine print: \"CONDITIONS TO INSTALLATION. 1.1... payment stuff. 2.2 Right-of-Way. Customer shall provide the right-of-way required for the installation of the Company's service facilities. Customer shall grant or obtain for the Company an easement along the route of the line extension in a form satisfactory to the Company.\" Question Since I never filed an easement and the utility company never asked (none exists), is it within my rights to deny them access to the property or force them to be more courteous? I completely understand they can shut down the service because technically this could be a breach of our contract for service. However, situations have come up recently (not just meter reading) where trespassing and damage to the property occurred. A security gate is soon to be installed. There is a perimeter fence which will be beefed up as well.

The title should be legally relevant, capture key aspects of the issue, and entice readers to learn more. \nQUESTION: Have a look at this hypothetical case: Assume that I apply for Irish Immigrant Investor Program. See page number 15, where in bold font, it is mentioned: The Immigrant Investor Programme recognises that investors who benefit from the programme may have substantial business and financial interests outside of Ireland. Therefore, actual physical residence in Ireland is not a condition for renewal of your residency permission under the Immigrant Investor Programme. This condition applies to both investors and their nominated family members. The programme simply requires investors and their family members to visit Ireland at least once per calendar year. Now assume that I apply for it and get a permission to live in Ireland based on my investment. The document mentions that the permission will be renewed every 5 years subject to the following conditions: You have not become a financial burden on the Irish State. You have not been investigated, indicted or convicted in relation to any criminal offence in any jurisdiction. Spend 1 day per year physically in Ireland Now, these are the current guidelines. If I have held such a permission to enter/remain in Ireland for 10 years (2 renewals) without actually residing in the country except 1 day stays each year (due to my business commitments outside Ireland and the fact that my primary home isn't Ireland), but suddenly Irish policy changes, and they tell me to start residing in Ireland within x amount of years (say within 1 year or within 2 years or may be within 6 months?), or tell me that this was your last 5 year renewal after which you will have to physically stay in Ireland to maintain your permission to stay and further renewals, can I approach an Irish court to argue that I had the right to stay in Ireland without any conditions except the 3 conditions above, regardless of the policy changes of Ireland because I invested (and made decisions about it) based on the conditions provided at that time? That is, are the conditions for renewal of the Immigrant Investor Programme (that are written in bold font) a good proof in a court to argue that no matter Ireland's policy changes, I entered the programme under those conditions and agreements and those conditions can't change for the people like me (who took the decision to choose Ireland because of the relaxed residency requirement)? In simpler words, imagine that a mother promises her child that she will buy her ice creams on demand every year if he (her son) excels in his final exams this year. Assume that the lured son does excel. And now imagine that her mother buys him ice cream this year, but next year changes her mind and thinks that her child should excel again the next year for next years' ice creams (which were not part of the original deal). In law, are such changes allowed when someone was explicitly and in bold font, told that the only physical residence condition was once a year? I want to know whether such changes/amendment of rules applied on people who were shown previous rules legit? If no, but if the Govt does apply it on me, can I approach a court to argue that I entered the Immigrant Investor Programme based on the conditions presented at that time and not based on the new rules? PS: By conditions, I chiefly mean the 1 day per year residence requirement. This one is important to me as I have business and family outside Ireland, so if they say sometime in the future to choose between start residing in Ireland to preserve my residence status (while abandoning my life abroad) vs lose my residence status, I will feel being cheated by changing the original set of conditions and requirements that were shown to me. I want to know whether such things are legally allowed or can I argue in a court on this matter? Can this be considered a legal breach of contract, for example? Any help will be appreciated greatly.

In the regulations the mere appearance of conflict of interest is ground for recusal (\"the employee should not participate in the matter\"), but allows an \"agency designee\" to waive this. My impression is that 2635.502 doesn't apply to a US vice-president because he is not an employee but an officer whereas 18 USC \u00a7 209 clearly applies to both officers and employees (both categories are mentioned in the latter, only employees in the former). As for why there would be such a discrepancy, i.e. a lower conflict-of-interest standard for the officers, there's parallel with the recusal of supreme justices, who aren't held to the higher recusal standard of 28 USC 455 presumably because the supreme justices are aren't as easily replaceable [on a case] as lower-level federal judges.

Not far from my house there is a dam in a creek. Just above the dam, there are bluffs on either side where people like to jump off from very high up into the water. Then they swim over to the bank and clamber up the (eroded) slope to do it again. News about the thrill of jumping at this spot has been spreading throughout the region, and the spot is now attracting 300 people per day in good weather. There are a number of problems with this: - Alcohol and serious drug use is increasing among the visitors (e.g. Ecstasy). - We're starting to see all-night parties occurring there. - The visitors leave their cars on nearby residential streets and cause a public nuisance -- littering, blocking residents' access to their driveways, peeing on people's lawns, changing clothes in public, being rude to residents. - There are occasional injuries at the location and every few years someone drowns there. Swimming, jumping, drinking, littering and staying past dark are all illegal there, but these activities are only a violation. Penalties are listed as \"a fine of not more than $250 or imprisonment for a term of not more than 15 days, and not less than $100 or 25 hours of community service.\" Our local law enforcement doesn't have enough staffing to go there every day to patrol the area, and when they do go, they feel so outnumbered that they don't feel that it's safe to issue citations -- they are concerned there might be a violent backlash from the crowd. Question 1: Would it be stronger deterrent to make swimming and jumping a criminal offense, with stronger penalties? Question 2: How would concerned citizens draft a law to make swimming and jumping a criminal offense? Question 3: The creek is owned by the City (the smallest entity geographically); the area around the dam is under Town jurisdiction; the policing around the dam is provided by the County sheriff's department, because the Town does not have its own police force.

The title should be legally relevant, capture key aspects of the issue, and entice readers to learn more. \nQUESTION: As a hypothetical: Company A is a competitor of Company B. Management of Company A thinks that Company A is so much better than Company B that Company B will soon go out of business. After getting approval from all major stakeholders of Company A, management publicly announces plans to short Company B and provides their reasons for doing so, but these reasons are mostly subjective. For example, the management of Company A believes that Company A has a better culture, smarter employees, and more efficient processes. Later on, Company A does short Company B, and Company B shortly thereafter goes out of business, making Company A a lot of money. Has Company A (or its executives acting on Company A's behalf) committed insider trading? According to rule 240.10b5-1, insider trading is defined as: among other things, the purchase or sale of a security of any issuer, on the basis of material nonpublic information about that security or issuer, in breach of a duty of trust or confidence that is owed directly, indirectly, or derivatively, to the issuer of that security or the shareholders of that issuer, or to any other person who is the source of the material nonpublic information. On the one hand, there was no breach of trust as Company A, with approval from stakeholders, made a good faith effort to publicize their actions and information used to justify these actions in advance. On the other hand, a reasonable person might argue that management of Company A had an unfair advantage over other investors in Company B in that they were acting on \"nonpublic information about that security\". Specifically, management of Company A knew firsthand what Company A was actually like- information that is relevant to the prospects of their competitor, Company B. The general investing public outside of Company A had to rely on the claims of management, which might reasonably be taken with a grain of salt since many companies claim to have \"the best\" culture and talent. I understand that this question is fairly speculative, so to make things a little less theoretical, I would prefer answers that provide specific regulations, court cases, or legislation addressing the following issues central to this question: Is there some privileged information that simply cannot be acted upon even if made public since it cannot be publicly verified in an objective way (e.g. the firsthand impression of management of how well the company is doing)? To put it another way: is an indirect duty of trust owed by management of a company to the entire general investing public- not just investors in the company itself? To what extent does getting the approval of stakeholders in Company A and publicly announcing planned actions in advance protect against insider trading regulations? (Note that this is different than the typical case of employees filing plans to buy or sell stock in their company in advance because (a) this involves another company's stock and (b) the plan is publicly announced after becoming aware of information relevant to the stock price of Company B not before.) \nTITLE: ", "output": "Does non-objectively justifiable optimism constitute insider trading?"}

The text is: As Z increases, the number of zeros increase exponentially. A Z of 396.3 is a chance in 1 in almost an infinite number or outcomes of finding the two results being from the same population There are 2 incorrect statements here: As Z increases, the number of zeros increase exponentially An exponential relationship means that as the independent variable (here Z) increases the dependent variable (here number of zeros) changes proportionally to a constant raised to the power of the independent variable. In this case, the number of zeros does go up a lot, and in a fairly complex way, but not precisely exponentially. A Z of 396.3 is a chance in 1 in almost an infinite number All finite numbers are equally far from infinity as all other finite numbers. \"Almost infinite\" has no meaning that I am aware of. A Z of 396.3 indicates a p value that has a lot of zeros.

University of Illinois and Hays v. Sony Corp in support of this statement. However, it seems to me that Weinsten v. University of Illinois explicitly considers university IP policy in making the determination of whether the scholarly work under consideration was \"work for hire\". First it says The statute is general enough to make every academic article a \"work for hire\" and therefore vest exclusive control in universities rather than scholars. See DuBoff, An Academic's Copyright: Publish and Perish, 32 J. Copyright Society 17 (1984). The University of Illinois, like many other academic institutions, responded to the 1978 revision of the copyright laws by adopting a policy defining \"work for hire\" for purposes of its employees, including its professors. then it quotes the university policy on work for hire, and then it makes a determination based on whether the university IP policy on work for hire can be interpreted to apply to the particular work under consideration: The University's copyright policy [on work for hire] reads more naturally when applied to administrative duties. Perhaps the University forms a committee to study the appropriate use of small computers and conscripts professors as members. The committee may publish a report, in which the University will claim copyright. We do not say that a broader reading is impossible, but such a reading should be established by evidence about the deliberations underlying the policy and the course of practice Furthermore, the more recent Bosch v. Ball-Kell refers to a directive in Weinstein, to look for evidence of intent from the history and deliberations that occurred in implementing the University's policy. Thus it is not clear to me whether the so-called \"teacher exception\" to work for hire applies if the university's intellectual property policy or contract asserts ownership of copyright of course materials. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Do faculty own the copyright to course materials they create even if their contract or university IP policy specify otherwise?"}

In Table 11 describes the General Subject Matter to be rooted in section 700 CMR 7.04(1)(a) that reads: 7.04: Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) (1) Use of the ETC System. The Department establishes the terms and conditions governing the use of an ETC system and requires that account holders accept these terms and conditions. (a) Unauthorized Use. No person may use the Department's ETC system or possess an electronic device that the Department issues for use with its ETC system unless: 700 CMR: MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 7.04: continued The electronic device is properly programmed to assess the appropriate toll charge that the Department determines is appropriate from time to time for the classification of the vehicle that is using the ETC system (i.e. commercial versus passenger vehicles), in accordance with the classification for that vehicle designated by the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles and in accordance with the vehicle classifications enumerated in 700 CMR 7.03; and the person is duly registered with the Department as a current account holder; the person is operating an authorized ETC-equipped motor vehicle with the permission of the account holder of the ETC-equipped motor vehicle; or the person is using an electronic device of an electronic toll collection system of another jurisdiction that the Department accepts for use in its ETC system.

It seems the view expressed boils down to \"An MOU is not a contract/binding agreement\". A senior negotiator responded asserting that an MOU IS an actual contract. Commentators poked fun at the head-of-state \"not knowing that an MOU is an agreement\". My belief loosely mirrored those expressed of the head-of-state's - ie that an MOU is more of a \"guidance document\" from which contracts/agreements follow. I expect a court might consider it as part of a understanding larger picture of an unclear agreement, but that an MOU is not a reliable legal document, often falling short of an agreement and are not binding to anything like the same extent that a contract is. (To the extent anyone may be aware of the specific MOU controversy in question, I do not believe that an MOU is meaningless, rather that it is an imprecise document with very limited enforce-ability. I do accept that the contents of the MOU make all the difference and some may be more enforceable then others depending the extent to which they contain all the elements of a contract) So 2 questions - Does an MOU have a different meaning/status/relevance in trade agreements to a typical MOU (a view expounded by some detractors of the head of state)?

I'm trying to move my partner into my flat in London. The situation is as follows: I have lived in the flat I rent for a bit over 2 years. This started as a 1 year Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) and became periodic after. At the two year mark (August), the landlord asked me to renew as a fixed-term again with a rent increase of about 9%. I agreed. I had moved in during covid when rents were very low and the new rate was reasonable. My partner is a joint tenant in a rented flat. Her tenancy ends at the start of December. When my landlord reached out to me about resigning with the rent increase in August, I mentioned that we would like to move in together. I made it clear that this would not happen until Nov/Dec when her tenancy ended. They agreed and asked for a \u00a330 referencing fee, which I paid. They immediately attempted referencing via their estate agents. This failed as what they tried to do was sign her as a co-tenant, which would have meant she was a tenant on 2 AST rentals at the same time. Apparently that's an issue (though I couldn't get a straight answer on this). Her landlords also refused to give a reference because she hadn't given notice, and refused to accept notice as she had more than two months left on her tenancy. I suggested they instead just make an amendment to give me permission to sub-let to her, as the intention was always that I would continue to pay the rent and be responsible for the flat. I was just told that the referencing had failed and we could try again once my partner was in the final two months of her tenancy and had given notice. I didn't receive a refund for the referencing fee, and didn't chase for one as I thought it would just cover the costs when we resumed the process. We're now in the final months of my partners tenancy and she's put her notice in. A new tenant has been found to replace her, so it's too late to back out. I reached out to the landlord to let them know this and that we could therefore pick up the referencing again and amend the contract. Their response summarised is as follows: The referencing is now \"\u00a350 plus VAT\" i.e. \u00a360. I've pointed out the original \u00a330 and received no acknowledgement. I've confirmed they do indeed mean \"plus VAT\". Due to an unexpected increase in the fee for the building shared boiler, they want to increase the rent by up to an additional 6% a month. I stress, they have not said this is because of an additional tenant and that I had already flagged a second tenant well in advance of agreeing the first rent increase. I've seen no proof of this increased cost to them. Needless to say I'm unhappy as I would not have resigned knowing all this. We're intending to move out next August anyway and at this point I'm past caring about maintaining a good relationship with the landlord. Looking for advice on the following: What could happen if we simply moved in together? I'm aware the landlord could pursue eviction, but how long would this take. If we're intending to move out anyway, I wouldn't be bothered if it meant leaving earlier. Could it affect our deposit? Could they sue? Would it have longer term implications to referencing for us when say, buying a home? Am I right to contest the referencing cost? My understanding is that they aren't allowed to charge for referencing, only a tenancy amendment which should not be withheld unreasonably. My contract does not state an amendment cost. Is there a means to complain about a landlord's behaviour to a third party? If so, what should the focus of my complaint be? Are there any grounds here?

In Question 2 of this practice exam (page 26), we have a contract for a good valued at $15,000 with an express warranty on its condition and a disclaimer against implied warranties of merchantability and fitness. Both provided answers note that the express warranty appears to be violated and that alone is sufficient for breach of contract and various damages. But they both also note that UCC Article 2 would also result in a breach of contract due to the failure of the seller to procure \"perfect goods\". My confusion is with the idea of \"perfect\" or \"conforming\" goods. The answers seem to suppose that the goods need to be capable of ordinary use in order to be perfect/conforming, but that isn't actually in the contract itself except from the implied warranty of merchantability which was disclaimed. So where does my understanding run afoul? What makes these goods imperfect if we ignore the express warranty and have disclaimed all implied warranties? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Perfect tender rule vs (disclaimed) implied warranty?"}

Then at registration the participant is provided their package with a wristband if they are 21+.

It follows other answers in observing that any piece of information can be encoded by numbers. Yes, there are pieces of information that are illegal to possess \u2013 e.g., child pornography, stolen intellectual property, financial numbers intended to commit theft or fraud. But it asserts, without reference to law, that if you don't know that application of the number your possession can't be illegal.

I can't think of a circumstance in which one could be charged for a crime for possession without knowledge of the significance of the number. I know this is a \"prove a negative\" problem, but if anyone knows of a possession crime that does not require a guilty mind that would be noteworthy. Is there a safe harbor for possession of an \"illegal\" number? If you are found in possession of stolen property, even if you lack mens rea, you are not allowed to keep it. If you are found in possession of stolen data can you keep it if it also represents something you can possess?

This is a new charge. It must not exceed $100. Before January 1, 2011, successful parties could claim as much as $50 for \"preparation and filing of pleadings\". This cost was a fee, not a disbursement, and it was meant to cover not only time spent in preparing pleadings but also filing them. Now, the cost is supposed to be a disbursement, but it relates only to preparation of pleadings, not filing them in court. It is arguable that this disbursement now covers reasonable legal fees charged to the client for preparing the Claim or Defence. Up until now, in general, lawyers' brush with Small Claims Court has been at the pleading stage only. They would draft the pleadings and then send the clients on to the trial to fend for themselves. If the client won the action, the judge would ask the client whether he was inter- ested in costs, and he would mainly answer affirmatively, and then claim the fee that he had paid his lawyer for drawing the Claim or Defence. Generally speaking, that disbursement was not allowed. Usually, p. 259 Top lawyers' recoverable compensation occurred when they represented party in court. Now, since the beginning of 201 1, a successful plaintiff or defendant may request as costs the fee charged by the lawyer (or paralegal) for drafting the pleading, up to $100. The size of the fee is rather minimal, but it was based on the recognition that costs are not intended to be a full indemnity but rather a partial indemnity, as we have seen from the earlier discussion of the components of costs. I read: Disbursements (that is, the law firm's out of pocket expenses) will be accounted for, and added to the bill. This from p. 260 states more about 'costs' vs 'fees'. Yet I still don't understand the bolded sentence's apparent distinction of 'disbursement' vs 'fees.' \nTITLE: ", "output": "Cost of preparing pleadings: Disbursement vs Fees"}

For example: The fallout from nuclear detonations. The various epidemiological and ecotoxicological consequences of perchlorate, i.e., rocket fuel (full disclosure: my dad is a scientist cited in the linked EPA document). The long-term ramifications of napalm in Vietnam, on both the soldiers who used it and the environment and people of that country. What I am curious about is a situation in which these secondary and tertiary ramifications effect some unrelated third party. For instance, maybe some wind blows a bunch of radioactive fallout-dust from country B which just got bombed over to neutral country A. Or maybe the napalm dropped on country B poisons the water which flows into country A, and which is the only major water supply for that country. Etc. In a situation like this, would the neutral third party have any standing in international law to state that these secondary or tertiary effects constitute an act of war? Obviously any despot can say \"I'm counting this as an act of war\" and then wage war, but is there any legal or historical basis to think that international bodies such as the U.N. would generally take the side of the hypothetical country A in such a scenario? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Fallout/pollution as act of war?"}

The goal is to inspire an arrest or use of force without giving a true justification (they are prepared to be killed, but only if their killing is unjust). The act itself is entirely legal and should not cause alarm to a reasonable person, but is designed to make a police officer feel suspicious or endangered should they be hyper-vigilant, and ultimately waste their time.

He wanted a change of pace, so he reached out and got recruited by a well-known transportation company who offered him a position as a long-haul driver. He already has a commercial driver's license from California, but it's been about 8 years since he last drove professionally, so they said he needed a \"refresher course\". This course is offered and mentioned on their website. So the he and the recruiter reached an agreement: Course is 1-week long It would cost him $1,400 Takes place in Arizona Starts on May 9th These details were discussed over the phone, but there are also e-mails from the recruiter, and corroborated on their website. With these dates agreed upon, he quit his job and his last day was April 29th. He took the next few days off, and when he reached out to go get his physical exam he got nothing but silence from the recruiter. He called, e-mailed, and texted all week long, and didn't hear anything. On May 10th (the day after he was supposed to start training) they finally contacted him to tell him that they cannot offer him the \"refresher course\", but he'd have to take the full commercial drivers' license training course.

The wording of CC BY-SA licenses changed significantly between versions 3.0 and 4.0, but I don't believe Creative Commons (CC) intended to narrow the scope of share alike (I explain why later). When I read the licenses, however, it seems to me that the scope has narrowed, which makes me suspect that my concept of what the scope is for either 3.0 or 4.0 is wrong. In this question, consider an example where someone uses several illustrations released together under a CC BY-SA license to create a book. The illustrations are completely unaltered; the author simply places an illustration on each page with some separate (but related) text to create the book. Different scope between 3.0 and 4.0 licenses Under a CC BY-SA 4.0 license, I believe the author is not required to release the book itself as CC BY-SA (or equivalent), so this is out of the scope of the share-alike clause. To paraphrase the 4.0 license legal code, for the book to be Adapted Material, the book must be based on the licensed work (which is the case) and modify the licensed material (which has not happened). Only Adapted Material must be shared alike, therefore this is not required to be. This argument for 4.0 appears to be agreed upon in this question. Under a CC BY-SA 3.0 license, I believe the author is required to release the book itself as CC BY-SA (or equivalent), so this is within the scope of the share-alike clause. To paraphrase the 3.0 license legal code, for the book to be an Adaptation, it must be based upon the work (which is the case) and not be a collection (it's not a collection - see below). Adaptations must be shared alike, therefore this is required to be. A collection must include work in 'its entirety in unmodified form' (which is the case), 'along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves'. The only other contribution is the added text, which is not independent from the images since the images are chosen (or text is written) so that they go well together. Why the scope shouldn't have narrowed CC explicitly state here that the scope of share alike hasn't changed, and state more generally that adding a clarification to narrow the scope of adaptations would 'abuse the trust of licensors' (see end of point 2 and point 3 in the ShareAlike intent document). Yes, the wording of the licenses have changed significantly, for example, in 4.0, there's no explicit mention of collections, but this is presumably due to the specific aim of 4.0 to make the license internationally applicable and easily understood. CC state here, for example, that not explicitly addressing collections 'does not change the scope of the license or the ShareAlike term'.

I heard from someone online claiming to be a law student that they might be, and I was disturbed at the thought that a court could potentially enforce physical contact. For a specific example, let's say there's a contract that allows one party to spank the other at their discretion. Let's also say that the victim in this contract also receives some monthly stipend (just to take care of the \"consideration\" rules, maybe $200). Let's also say there's some sort of outrageous, one-sided termination clause--like $100,000 for the victim to terminate the contract. I'm thinking this wouldn't be enforceable for the following reasons: Spanking an adult constitutes battery/assault, which is a criminal offense, and a contract cannot have terms that are illegal or criminal. If there was a prior romantic relationship between the two parties, the contract might have been made under coercion (I'm not sure of the exact terms, obviously IANAL) The outrageous, one-sided termination clause might be used as evidence the contract was signed under duress, or it might violate some other principle that would void the contract I'm mostly interested in what specific laws/legal principles would prevent this from being enforced, or if I'm wrong and the law student was actually right.

Many third-party products also integrate the VirusTotal API so that binaries are automatically uploaded based on system scans. The way VirusTotal makes money is that they charge subscription fees so that other users can download the binaries that were uploaded. So my question is, doesn't this violate the copyright of the binary authors? Now, obviously malware authors are not going to claim ownership of their binaries but a lot of other non-malicious binaries get uploaded to VirusTotal. And because anti-virus engines are not perfect they will mark legitimate software as malware. When a binary is marked as malware, according to VirusTotal, it will send that sample to other third parties as part of a sharing program. In summary: VirusTotal allows anyone to upload any binary regardless of the EULA of the software. VirusTotal facilitates sharing of the binary again regardless of the EULA. VirusTotal profits off the uploaded binaries by charging a subscription fee. VirusTotal provides no recourse available when legitimate software is marked as malware, only to contact each individual anti-virus company to report the false positive.

Secondary Sources: Laughing at the Gods: Great Judges and How They Made the Common Law, p. 32 Middle. Although Mansfield's more expansive judicial style is hardly considered novel or original today, its innovative and almost groundbreaking quality at the time cannot be exag- gerated. Judges tended to see themselves as operating under more prosaic restrictions than the poetic Mansfield would allow. He was unafraid to irrigate the dry soil of legal rules with more invigorating waters. For instance, in Trueman v. Fenton in 1777, he opined that \"I never like to entangle justice in matters of [1.] form [End of 1.] and [2.] to turn parties around upon frivolous objections [End of 2.] where I can avoid it \u2014 [3.] it only tends to the ruin and destruction of both. [End of 3.]\" Consequently, Mansfield believed not that he was making new law but that he was liberating the real and abiding principles of the common law from the enchainment of earlier mistaken characteri- zations. As he put it in Pugh v. Duke of Leeds in the same year, the proper judicial task was \"not to make new law, but to vindicate the old from misrepresentation.\" Although he did not go so far as to declare that unjust rules could not be law (as some of his later judicial heirs, like Tom Denning, have done), he did work his hardest to make law and justice coalesce. Lord Mansfield: Justice in the Age of Reason, p. 229 Middle. Mansfield's decisions in commercial cases, as in other areas of the law, were intensely practical. Where he thought it necessary or appropriate, he abandoned the formality Of traditional common law pleading rules in order to provide legal protection to a broad range of commercial assets, transactions, and practices.70 His aim was to get as quickly as possible to the essential issue or issues involved in a dispute and to resolve the dispute in accordance with principles Of justice and fair dealing. He Stated in one opinion: \"I never like to entangle justice in matters of form, and to turn parties round on frivolous objections where I can avoid it. It only tends to the ruin and destruction of both ...

Why can't such a defendant rely on Necessity, but can rely on Duress of Circumstances? 2.5 Duress of Circumstances In some cases where the defendant does the lesser of two evils he or she will be able to rely on the defence of duress of circumstances. For example, in Pipe v DPP86 a man was driving his ill son to hospital and broke the speed limit. Owen J held that the jury should have been allowed to consider whether he could rely on duress of circumstances (or necessity as he called it). As will be discussed in Section 5 of this chapter, duress provides a defence where the defendant reasonably believes that the circumstances are such that unless he or she commits a crime he or she or another will suffer death or serious injury and that a reasonable person in the same situation would have committed the crime. This defence clearly overlaps to some extent with necessity. Being faced with the threat of death which the defendant avoids by driving through a red light would fall under the defence of duress of circumstances; it would also be said to be the lesser of two evils. However, duress of circumstances is in some sense narrower and in some sense wider than necessity. It is narrower in that duress of circumstances is not available in order to avoid a threat less than death or grievous bodily harm [abbreviated GBH]. However, where it is available necessity may provide a defence even where the harm threatened is less than serious harm. Duress of circumstances is wider than a necessity defence would be, in that it covers the situation where the defendant reasonably believed there to be a threat of death or serious injury, even if there was in fact no such threat. A necessity defence would not cover such a situation.87 Further, if the defendant was threatened with grievous bodily harm unless he or she caused grievous bodily harm, although the two kinds of harm may be the same and so he or she may not be able to rely on necessity, he or she may be able to rely on duress of circumstances and argue that a reasonable person would have given in to the threat. 86 [2012] EWHC 1821 (Admin).

Sorry for the long quote; please advise me if and how I can abridge it. Tenacity is more than an aspect of courage. Counsel must expect to cross-examine many witnesses whose evidence he will fail to destroy. He must also expect to come across a number who believe that attack is the best method of defence, and who will do all they can to embarrass him. Two such witnesses appeared in the 'Black Book' criminal libel case tried at the Old Bailey during the First World War. Noel Pemberton-Billing, independent member of Parliament for Hertford, alleged that German secret agents had compiled a list of 2,000 prominent people whose sexual proclivities and abnormalities had led to an irresolute prosecution of the war. When he criticized the dancer Maud Allen in obscene language for playing the part of Salom\u00e9 in Oscar Wilde's play she prosecuted him for criminal libel. Hume Williams was briefed to prosecute. He had an extensive practice in the Divorce Division, but this did not fit him for the rougher atmosphere of the criminal courts, nor for witnesses who were prepared to stick at nothing in order to win. It allowed an unscrupulous man, with a full wave of national sentiment and war hysteria behind him, to secure his own acquittal and a travesty of justice at the same time. One of the witnesses for the defence made a reply to Hume Williams in cross-examination which led him to ask, with a note of incredulity in his voice. WILLIAMS: People in the service of Germany are able to get British secret service agents marooned [on the Greek islands] by the orders of the British Government? WITNESS: Yes. I think I told you that privately. WITNESS: Do you not remember talking to me? WILLIAMS: Never! WITNESS: When I came back from Albania you met me at dinner we had a conversation together. WILLIAMS: I have never met you in my life. WITNESS: I quite expected you to say that. WILLIAMS: Because it is the truth. WITNESS: You were never at the Clitheroes'? JUDGE: I expect one or other of you will get marooned. The loud laughter which greeted this sally of the Judge's disguised the defensive nature of Williams's last assertion. When one of the later witnesses made a similar claim, that she had ported a 'dangerous state of affairs' direct to Hume Williams who had advised her, 'there are too many people involved to make a personal sacrifice to expose it', [1.] he was impotent to deal with the situation. [2.] He had allowed himself to become personally involved. I do not understand 1. Williams was correct to refute the Witness's falsities; so how was Williams impotent? If Williams had ignored them, then the audience may infer that the Witness was speaking the truth? How is 2 true?

However, in early December, it was revealed that the SEC and FINRA were investigating the transaction as early as November. Does the SEC/FINRA have the legal authority to block a SPAC merger even if wrongdoing is found? My understanding is that mergers can only be blocked if they violate antitrust laws, and since that clearly isn't the case here, can the SEC/FINRA block the merger on other grounds? My understanding is that the SEC has never blocked a SPAC merger from going through and that the first time it ever issued enforcement measures, only fines were issued to the SPAC company (https://www.cov.com/en/news-and-insights/insights/2021/07/first-spac-related-sec-enforcement-action-targets-spacs-alleged-due-diligence-failures). If the wrongdoing is significant enough, could the SEC force the SPAC to replace its management, or is this not an issue to begin with considering the SEC will eventually have to let the merger go through once fines are issued and once the SPAC complies with securities laws? This is of course dependent on whether the SPAC is found to violate antitrust laws, but if that isn't the case, is it correct that the SEC/FINRA don't have the legal authority to block a merger? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Does the SEC/FINRA have the legal authority to block a SPAC merger if it doesn't violate antitrust laws?"}

It was taken from a tumor in Henrietta Lacks without her knowledge, consent or property transfer agreement. It has developed into an important tool in medical research. It is available to buy from multiple sources, for example ATCC. While it is not quite clear under what terms you are purchasing them, I think it is under this material transfer agreement (MTA). It states: ATCC and/or its Contributors shall retain ownership of all right, title and interest in the ATCC Materials, including such ATCC Materials contained or incorporated in Modifications. This indicates that there are some rights, title and interest beyond physical possession that applies to these cells, that they are currently owned by ATCC, and that the rights extend to child cells of those originally provided (despite those derivative cells including a small proportion of the actual atoms that were originally provided, in much the same way as the cells will include very little of the actual atoms that were part of Henrietta Lacks). Are there any such rights? If so, how did companies such as ATCC come to possess them? The wiki mentions the case of Moore v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 51 Cal.3d 120, 271 Cal.Rptr. 146, 793 P.2d 479, 483 (1990) which seems to establish that individuals do not have rights to a share in the profits earned from commercial products or research derived from their cells, but does not seem to explain how anyone else gains those rights, other than from possession or via a consent form (that John Moore signed but Henrietta Lacks did not). In particular the finding that 'At the very least, Moore had the \"right to do with his own tissue what the defendants did with it\"'. This would seem to indicate that the estate of Henrietta Lacks would have any rights that ATCC is claiming, but not what those rights are or from where ATCC gained them. \nTITLE: ", "output": "From where do the non-physical ownership rights over the HeLa cell line derive?"}

DWORD pid; GetWindowThreadProcessId( foo, &pid ); HANDLE handle = OpenProcess( PROCESS_TERMINATE, FALSE, pid); TerminateProcess( handle, -5 ); ...

Are there prior lawsuits related to this? I'm mostly interested in the particular case where the copy is not reproduced, but kept private. I've recently learned that this is indeed the case. This came as a huge surprise to me since: [First of all] most browsers retain a copy of the HTML (for the period of the visit or much longer, if caching is enabled) Proxy servers often keep cached copies of these files Web archives (like Google's) not only copy all assets of a site it find to keep historical versions of these pages but also make available to the general public these historical copies. Programs that scrape external sites often have in their repositories copies of (likely copyrighted) HTML for testing purposes Number (4) is the one that directly affects the company I work for, since we do web analysis and therefore write programs that visit other sites. For example, we make extensive use of vcrpy library to record external accesses and test our code against these \"frozen\" HTMLs. Also, specifically in our case, we don't really copy the entirety of any site, since we are only concerned with a subset of its pages, but from what I've been informed, that doesn't seem to qualify as \"fair use\", such as quoting a passage of a book (where, in a sense, the book would be analogous to the entire site with all its public assets). We don't even copy assets like CSS files or images, so we can't reproduce the actual content in full. After I was told that such copies are likely unlawful, we are not only being limited to explore more robust testing methodologies (which would likely make use of a large amount of HTML copied from the web in a local storage) but the current use of vcrpy library has become something that demanded analysis (as it's not clear if our use of it is unlawful). \nTITLE: ", "output": "Copying HTML: copyright violation?"}

And this is not the only one: there are a lot of similar movements that claim independence of some state or region, but this one is specially featured because there are historic issues about independent movements in the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, that led to a major war in the Brazilian empire times, plus a lot of disagreement in this region about federal tax collection and distribution, and a lot of other major issues. On one side, the self-determination of the people is understood, in light of international law, as a peremptory norm (jus cogens). On the other side, Brazil's constitution says, in its first article, that \"The Federative Republic of Brazil, formed by the indissoluble union of the states and municipalities and of the federal district, is a legal democratic state [...]\" Considering the long historic of repression of independence movements in Brazil (only two in dozens of them succeeded in the last 500 years, one of those being Brazil's own independence); plus the fact that the Free South movement itself was forbidden and the first engaged people imprisoned during the military rule, it's probable that if asked our Supreme Court would decide in favor of the constitution.

The EU apparently cannot interfere in National legislation of member states to remove these schemes that have the potential of fraud and other security risks. It just directs member states to be careful as a golden visa scheme introduced by national legislation directly affects other member states due to free movement rights.

Business to business transfer of personal data is a common occurrence, but I have never been informed of such a transfer in a way that seems to conform to this article. Am I interpreting this wrong, or are many large organisations breaching this law? Art. 14 GDPR Information to be provided where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject Where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject, the controller shall provide the data subject with the following information: A load of metadata about the PII In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the data subject with the following information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject: Another load of metadata about the PII The controller shall provide the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2: Within a month, when they contact the data subject or when they share with a third party, whichever is earlier. If you are going to do something new, tell the data subject Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not apply where and insofar as: the data subject already has the information; the provision of such information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort, in particular for processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in Article 89(1) or in so far as the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing. In such cases the controller shall take appropriate measures to protect the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, including making the information publicly available; obtaining or disclosure is expressly laid down by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which provides appropriate measures to protect the data subject\u2019s legitimate interests; or where the personal data must remain confidential subject to an obligation of professional secrecy regulated by Union or Member State law, including a statutory obligation of secrecy. There are multiple organisations in the UK that take data from entities other than the data subject and pass data to third parties using an API where the data is returned within milliseconds of the request being made. These organisations include the credit reference agencies, the DVLA either directly or via MyLicence and the Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance System. All these organisations collect personal data about indaviduals from entities other than the indaviual, process that data and share the results with third parties via a REST API that returns the PII immediately the request is made. From my reading of article 14 of the GDPR that they should inform me that they are holding this data within a month of collecting it, and at the latest at the point that the API response is sent, unless one of the situations in point 5 apply. I have never had such a communication from any of these entities. With regards these situations in point 5 it is not obvious which could be relevant. All of these are about the individual, so not archiving, research or statistical purposes (b). I guess there is no obligation of professional secrecy (d). There may be explicit legal requirements for some of this processing, but I am not aware of any \"expressly laid down by Union or Member State law\" that would cover all this (c). (a) is slightly harder to interpret, as it is not clear exactly what information is being referred to. If it is the originally captured PII then this whole article would almost never apply as the data subject usually has access to their own data. If it means the list of metadata in sections 1 and 2 this exception would almost never apply, as for example the data subject will never know the period for which the personal data will be stored. Am I reading it wrong, are these large organisation is obvious breach of the GDPR or is there another source of confusion? For an example of when this happened to me, I got a parking ticket based on a ANPR camera. I made a subject access request, and I got a web service request and response, formated as XML. The request had my number plate and no information about the legal basis for processing, the response had my name and address (which I provided), the vehicle details (which came from a third party, the manufacturer I guess) and a load of codes that no one explained. It would seem that these transfers of PII would make both the DVLA and the parking firm data controllers engaged in transfer of PII derived from sources other than the data subject, and therefore both separately responsible for informing me of the details of the transfer. Specifically, passing the make, model and colour of the car (provided by a third party) to the parking control would bring section 3. (c) into play and I should be told \"at the latest when the personal data are first disclosed\", ie. when the web service returned. However I was not aware of it until I made the SAR. \nTITLE: ", "output": "How does GDPR Art. 14 apply to large scale B2B data transfer"}

The police are going to try to get me to do things that may be against my own self interest, such as answering potentially incriminating questions, provide my DNA/fingerprints to them, or consent to a search. The police are going to do their best to make it sound as if I should, or have to, do this without informing me that I have a choice in the matter, all this stuff helps them with their job and they have no incentive not to do so.

My question is whether or not the police officer has to inform me that I could refuse to give the DNA sample? A police officer has the right to utilize deception to get evidence, and I've already foolishly sacrificed my own right to an attorney present to answer these sort of questions for me.

The title should be legally relevant, capture key aspects of the issue, and entice readers to learn more. \nQUESTION: So, let me get specific so I can get a more accurate answer. My fiance's daughter had been in the custody of the State of Oregon for about 10 years. Yes, a ten year open case. She was taken from her mother. My fiance (at the time) did not have a stable living situation or employment (but was NEVER a safety concern) so Oregon wouldn't give him custody. After about a year into the state having custody of his daughter he was in the position to have custody of his daughter. But, the state wouldn't grant custody. The state required my fiance to take many classes (he did). But, there was always another hurdle for him to jump. When I met my fiance almost 6 years ago he had his own 2 bedroom appt., a job and was living a normal life, but, without his daughter. We began to push back and write letters to the state, all attorneys involved, DHS, the juvenile judge ect. the case had gotten so bad and the judge, case workers and attorneys have gotten biased and had their own plans for his daughter. They began to make a permanent plan for where his daughter will live and the life she will have for her remaining childhood. A court date was set to finally TAKE my fiancee parental rights (as he would not ever willingly give them up). Three days before that court date, a meeting was frantically put together by DHS and they invited my fiance, his attorney, the mother of his daughter, her attorney, his daughter, her attorney and casa, the case workers involved in the case and a supervisor whom my fiance has never met. The purpose of that meeting was to see if my fiance was going to willingly give up his rights (it was a quick meeting). The DHS supervisor also stated that he had NEVER seen a case that big and open for so many years. Three days later, we went into court and that DHS supervisor asked to speak to the judge, attorneys and casa. They all went into the judges chambers and when they all returned that DHS supervisor said that DHS is pulling out of the case and told the judge that she should grant custody to my fiance. The judge tried to talk DHS out of that decision but DHS told her they won't continue to keep custody of my fiances daughter. The judge continued to struggle with that decision and got DHS to agree to staying involved in our lives for 3 months if she were to grant my fiance custody. A week later, we had full custody of my fiances daughter. During all the time the state had custody of his daughter he racked up some owed child support to the state as well as paid the state thousands of dollars. They took his tax returns every dang year, until last year! We know that DHS pulled out of the case and the judge was basically forced to give my fiance his daughter because as soon as that supervisor from DHS looked over the case he realized they should have given custody to my fiance YEARS AGO! While we will never be able to get back the time and raising his daughter who is now 16, we want the child support that the state took while they kept custody of his child when they shouldn't have. How do we go about finding someone to help us? What sort of lawyer should we contact? Any immediate steps we should take to make this process quick and easy? And, is there any cheap way to go about this? I'm a stay at home mom and my fiance supports our family of 6. We are considered low income right now and DHS has a huge part in our crappy financial situation. Any and all suggestions will help and be very appreciated.

As the court said in Heyman v Darwins (1942): The other party may \u2026 \u2019accept the repudiation\u2019 by so acting as to make it plain that, in view of the wrongful action of the party who has repudiated, he claims to treat the contract as at an end, in which case he can sue at once for damages. This acceptance must generally be communicated to the other party (described as a \u2018basic and well known principle\u2019 by the Privy Council in Sookraj v Samaroo (2004)) or at least \u2018overtly evinced\u2019 to him, but can the innocent party accept the repudiation by mere failure to perform its future obligations? In State Trading Corpn [not a typo] of India (1989), the Court of Appeal suggested not, since \u2018such conduct would be equivocal and equally consistent with a decision not to exercise the right to treat the contract as repudiated\u2019. How's the emboldened phrase true? Suppose a promisee contracted to do/not do something. If he then doesn't/does it, can't the promisor infer that the promisee's mere failure to perform future obligations consists with the promisee's decision to repudiate the contract? Westlaw has The State Trading Corporation of India Limited v M. Golodetz Limited: This brings me to what I would respectfully regard as a red herring in the argument on behalf of STC which the learned judge considered at p. 188 of his judgment. STC sought to counter the arbitrators' finding that on 23rd December the sellers had brought the contract to an end (in the popular sense) by submitting that STC's silence or continuing unwillingness to open the letter of credit between 19th and 23rd December might in itself be regarded as an acceptance of the sellers' assumed breach of condition. In my view this is not a tenable proposition. What is commonly referred to as an acceptance of a repudiation must be communicated to the party in breach or at least overtly evinced: see e.g. Chitty on Contracts, 25th ed. vol. 1 para. 1598, Heyman v. Darwins (1942) AC 356 at p. 361 and The Mihalis Angelos (1971) 1 QB 164 explicitly at p. 204 E per Megaw LJ. The decision of the High Court of Australia in Holland v. Wiltshire (1954) 90 CLR 409 shows that an unequivocal overt act which is inconsistent with the subsistence of the contract may be sufficient, without any concurrent manifestation of intent directed to the other party. But saying and doing nothing at all, other than a continuing failure to perform, cannot constitute an acceptance of a repudiation even if the grounds for such an acceptance then exist. Such conduct would be equivocal and equally consistent with a decision not to exercise the right to treat the contract as repudiated. It follows that I cannot accept that STC's silence and inactivity between 18th and 23rd December can be regarded as having had any legal consequences. No doubt they were reluctant, if not unwilling, to pay a large sum in U.S. dollars against documents for a cargo lying at the bottom of the sea, perhaps in particular since it was insured in India and therefore not necessarily in some external currency. Such a reaction would be commercially understandable although legally incorrect. \nTITLE: ", "output": "How's a \"mere failure to perform future obligations\" equivocal and equally consistent with not exercising the right to repudiate the contract?"}

The publishing industry has a long history of permitting pseudonyms for a variety of purposes. Technically (as I understand it), using the name \"Matt Smith\" when your full legal name is \"Matthew Clay Smith\" is using a pseudonym, though it is one that isn't intended to obfuscate the legal identity of the author. On the other hand, writing romance novels as \"Matt Smith\" may not be as marketable as writing them under the pseudonym \"Alicia Caring.\" Given the following examples (which in no way exhaust the possibilities), am I as the website creator or the company I form to encompass it legally liable for misrepresentation and can that liability be disclaimed with appropriate Terms & Conditions boiler plate? Natural derivative of my legal name with photo of myself. Intentionally obfuscating pseudonym with photo of myself. Intentionally obfuscating pseudonym with stock photo of someone else. Please note that there are no (or it's highly unlikely) ad hominem commercial claims. Merely the adoption of an alias. And as such I might be making much ado about nothing. In the publishing industry, the purpose of an obfuscating pseudonym is to make it difficult or impossible to track down the real person (the publisher acting as the real person's agent). Pen names are rarely registered in the sense of a trademark. Usually, the use of a pseudonym is to either make it easier for the author to write to his/her market (most female writers of the 1800s wrote used men's names) or to divest themselves of ownership (Louis L'Amour famously denied to his dying day being the Tex Burns who wrote the Hopalong Cassidy novels).

The second generation (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1) is where my question comes in. Since A was living, are A1 and A2 considered part of the pool for that generation or not? In other words, is the $240,000 at this generation split between B1, B2, and C1; or is it split between A1, A2, B1, B2, and C1? The key here is the A branch, where A also has living children.

For example: a person is arrested and charged with a fairly significant offense (let's say armed robbery). However, he will not give his name and has no identification on his person, police cannot discover his identity through their systems (fingerprinting, etc), and no one comes forward who knows him. How would the average court system handle this case? If it is related, how would the defendants Fifth Amendment rights apply to their decision to refuse to identify themselves? Are they within their rights to do so throughout the entirety of the proceedings, or at some point are they at risk of being in contempt?

In relation to the exercise of a right of audience, a person is exempt if they have \"a right of audience before that court in relation to those proceedings granted by or under any enactment\" (LSA 2007, s 19 and sch 3(1)(3)). The Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, s 11(1) provides that: The Lord Chancellor [may] by order provide that there shall be no restriction on the persons who may exercise rights of audience, or rights to conduct litigation, in relation to proceedings in the county court of such a kind as may be specified in the order. Such an order has been passed in relation to rights of audience for the small claims track of the County Court. The Lay Representatives (Rights of Audience) Order 1999, art 3(1) provides that: [any] person may exercise rights of audience in proceedings dealt with as a small claim in accordance with rules of court. I have checked Westlaw and there does not appear to be an equivalent order made under the Act for the conduct of litigation. The right of audience is confirmed in the Civil Procedure Rules in relation to the small claims track. CPR 27 PD 3.2(1): \"A party may present his own case at a hearing or a lawyer or lay representative may present it for him\" and CPR 27 PD 3.2(4): \"Any of its officers or employees may represent a corporate party.\" Further rights are granted to company representatives for other tracks. CPR 39.6: \"A company or other corporation may be represented at trial by an employee if (a) the employee has been authorised by the company or corporation to appear at trial on its behalf; and (b) the court gives permission.\" My question: is there any associated exemption for the conduct of litigation, to mirror the rights of audience for lay representatives? It seems somewhat strange that a lay representative on the small claims track can address the judge and interview witnesses, but cannot issue the claim or conduct any other ancillary administrative tasks relating to the proceedings. On the other hands, I believe barristers using the direct access scheme face a similar restriction so perhaps this is a deliberate omission in the exemptions. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Exemption for \"conduct of litigation\" as a lay representative?"}

The service is not like Stripe, because they only abstract the connection with the banks' APIs. It is a business on its own, a smart currency exchange system, so it is required to apply KYC.

The user will be allowed to make a payment via B to only pay for A\u2019s services, therefore the funds will only go to one of their bank accounts. Logically, money laundering is out of question here, as A is already regulated, but I\u2019m not completely sure.

I play this song from memory and by ear; I have never written down the tune or words. Perhaps I invented this song while on tour, and I intend to make a recording when my tour is over. Over the course of the tour, there are thousands of eyewitness accounts to this song's existence and its authorship by me. Before I ever produce a recording of the song, though, a fan produces some kind of derivative recording (a cover, or a song that's simply very similar) of my song. Do I have any grounds to claim copyright infringement, considering that I never fixed the work as either a sound recording or written musical composition? (Let us ignore the fact that I could lie by creating such a fixation after the fact and saying that it predates the recording -- suppose I honestly admit as a point of pride, or am unable to deny due to long-term witness accounts, etc., that the song was never fixed prior to the creation of the fan work.) What if a fan recorded my actual performance with a camera at my show? In that case, I was in no way responsible for the creation of the recording, but a significant part of the recording's value is my music.

I'm not sure, but I think the term \"illegimitate\" was remove from the law altogether. Of course, this wreaked havoc at first since many \"hidden children\" had rights to be visited and were allowed access to a range of rights overnight.

In summary: Swindler made fake wills for sailors who had died intestate leaving high value estates. The wills looked real because they emulated the will forms that had been used by the Navy. The wills that the fraudster made disinherited relatives and left everything to various charities. He claimed to have discovered these \u201clost\" wills\u201d and approached the charities.

By what credible set of occurrences could have have led him to \u2018find\u2019 the \u2018lost\u2019 will as a non-family member, nor friend? Would he have to have somehow had access to the deceased's property after their death? Is there somewhere else he could have \u2018found\u2019 the will that would have been credible?

Only a tiny share of modern pardons are granted to people who are currently serving sentences for the crimes of which they were convicted or to people who have not yet been convicted of crimes.

Thus I want to ask for clarification on the part where it states that pardoned individuals \"apply for a job not available to felons, or vote, or get a hunting license and use a firearm\".

{"input": "Generate a concise, engaging title for the following legal question on an internet forum. The title should be legally relevant, capture key aspects of the issue, and entice readers to learn more. \nQUESTION: Is a police car parked perpendicular to the road (with flashing lights) sufficient by itself to legally establish road closure to all traffic -- including non-thru (i.e. local) traffic to a residence which can only be accessed via the \"closed\" road? There is no additional signage, traffic control devices, or police officers out of the car directing traffic. Research: Note: Take my research with a grain of salt. I am a legal \"enthusiast\" and certainly not an expert. I also have a vested interest in proving that such a road is not legally marked as closed since I was ticketed for driving on a closed road in exactly this scenario. Therefore, I worry that my research is biased in that I may have stopped too soon when I found clauses which seem to support what I was thinking when I drove past the police officer's car to my house. Please keep this in mind as you read further as I am interested in the correct legal interpretation of all governing laws rather than what I would like to be true from my relatively limited research into what I think might be the applicable laws. Police have the authority to regulate traffic via police officers or traffic control devices per 4511.07 of the Ohio Revised Code (ORC). Quoted text from the Ohio Revised Code 4511.07 Local traffic regulations. (A) Sections 4511.01 to 4511.78, 4511.99, and 4513.01 to 4513.37 of the Revised Code do not prevent local authorities from carrying out the following activities with respect to streets and highways under their jurisdiction and within the reasonable exercise of the police power: ... (2) Regulating traffic by means of police officers or traffic control devices; ... A road may be closed by the authority having jurisdiction with posted appropriate signs per ORC 4511.71 at which point it is illegal to drive upon the road. Signs are a requirement listed in 4511.71, therefore it appears it would be inappropriate for a police officer to issue a citation for driving on a closed road due to inappropriate signage unless: A case can be made for the police car with flashing lights parked perpendicular to the road as a \"traffic control device\" in and of itself since there was not a police officer actively directly traffic. There is some other section of the code that applies to emergencies or unexpected events that I am overlooking which gives broader authority to police discretion on how to indicate a road is closed. Quoted text from the Ohio Revised Code 4511.71 Prohibition against driving upon closed highway. (A) No person shall drive upon, along, or across a street or highway, or any part of a street or highway that has been closed in the process of its construction, reconstruction, or repair, and posted with appropriate signs by the authority having jurisdiction to close such highway. ... 4511.12 Obedience to traffic control devices. (A) No pedestrian, driver of a vehicle, or operator of a streetcar or trackless trolley shall disobey the instructions of any traffic control device placed in accordance with this chapter, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. No provision of this chapter for which signs are required shall be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of this chapter does not state that signs are required, that section shall be effective even though no signs are erected or in place. ... Now, if the police car parked perpendicular to the road with flashing lights is to be argued as a \"traffic control device\", it must conform to the state manual (Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices [OMUTCD] 2012 Edition) per ORC 4511.11: Quoted text from the Ohio Revised Code 4511.01 Traffic laws - operation of motor vehicles definitions. ... (QQ) \"Traffic control device\" means a flagger, sign, signal, marking, or other device used to regulate, warn, or guide traffic, placed on, over, or adjacent to a street, highway, private road open to public travel, pedestrian facility, or shared-use path by authority of a public agency or official having jurisdiction, or, in the case of a private road open to public travel, by authority of the private owner or private official having jurisdiction. ... 4511.11 Local conformity to manual for uniform system of traffic control devices. ... (D) All traffic control devices erected on any street, highway, alley, bikeway, or private road open to public travel shall conform to the state manual ... Per 6I.05 01 of OMUTCD:2012: \"Emergency-vehicle lighting, however, provides warning only and provides no effective traffic control\". Quoted text from Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices 2012 Edition CHAPTER 6I. CONTROL OF TRAFFIC THROUGH TRAFFIC INCIDENT MANAGEMENT AREAS ... Section 6I.05 Use of Emergency-Vehicle Lighting Support: 01 The use of emergency-vehicle lighting (such as high-intensity rotating, flashing, oscillating, or strobe lights) is essential, especially in the initial stages of a traffic incident, for the safety of emergency responders and persons involved in the traffic incident, as well as road users approaching the traffic incident. Emergency-vehicle lighting, however, provides warning only and provides no effective traffic control. The use of too many lights at an incident scene can be distracting and can create confusion for approaching road users, especially at night. Road users approaching the traffic incident from the opposite direction on a divided facility are often distracted by emergency-vehicle lighting and slow their vehicles to look at the traffic incident posing a hazard to themselves and others traveling in their direction. ... Therefore, I am left with the conclusion that as long as an individual slows down to pass the perpendicularly parked police car (in accordance with ORC 4511.213) in this scenario to reach his or her residence which is not blocked by the road obstruction, then the individual should not be ticketed for driving on a closed road (ORC 4511.71 quoted above) or failure to comply with police or traffic control instruction (ORC 4511.12 quoted above). Quoted text from the Ohio Revised Code 4511.213 Approaching stationary public safety vehicle displaying emergency light. (A) The driver of a motor vehicle, upon approaching a stationary public safety vehicle, emergency vehicle, road service vehicle, waste collection vehicle, vehicle used by the public utilities commission to conduct motor vehicle inspections in accordance with sections 4923.04 and 4923.06 of the Revised Code, or a highway maintenance vehicle that is displaying the appropriate visual signals by means of flashing, oscillating, or rotating lights, as prescribed in section 4513.17 of the Revised Code, shall do either of the following: (1) If the driver of the motor vehicle is traveling on a highway that consists of at least two lanes that carry traffic in the same direction of travel as that of the driver's motor vehicle, the driver shall proceed with due caution and, if possible and with due regard to the road, weather, and traffic conditions, shall change lanes into a lane that is not adjacent to that of the stationary public safety vehicle, emergency vehicle, road service vehicle, waste collection vehicle, vehicle used by the public utilities commission to conduct motor vehicle inspections in accordance with sections 4923.04 and 4923.06 of the Revised Code, or a highway maintenance vehicle. (2) If the driver is not traveling on a highway of a type described in division (A)(1) of this section, or if the driver is traveling on a highway of that type but it is not possible to change lanes or if to do so would be unsafe, the driver shall proceed with due caution, reduce the speed of the motor vehicle, and maintain a safe speed for the road, weather, and traffic conditions. Is there another law I am missing which contradicts my conclusion that a road in this scenario is not legally marked as closed? Just in Case Additional Detail Needed: Scenario: An unexpected obstruction occurs on 2-lane road that prevents through-traffic (e.g. car accident, downed telephone pole/power line). A police car is parked perpendicular to the road with flashing lights to allow other workers to clear the obstruction. The police car partially obstructs both main lanes of car travel, but there is enough room for a car to safely pass on the right-hand side of the road if utilizing the road's shoulder. There is no police officer outside of the car directing traffic, nor is it obvious that there is a police officer inside of the vehicle because the driver-side door is facing the obstruction rather than on-coming traffic. There are no signs of any kind in addition to the perpendicularly-parked police car. Road detail: 2 motorist lanes with 2 bicycle lanes (one on each outer edge of the road) There are driveways to residences directly off of this road. Several houses are completely obstructed on both sides. 35 mph speed limit Typical traffic is approximately 30 cars/minute during the busiest hours of the road's \"closure\". \nTITLE: ", "output": "Is a police car parked perpendicular to the road (with flashing lights) sufficient by itself to legally establish road closure to all traffic?"}

Here is an exact excerpt from it: Termination This Licence shall end on the earliest of: 9.1. 31 May 2020; and a) the expiry of a two weeks' notice given by the Licensor to the Licensee at any time of breach of any of the Licensee's obligations contained in clause 3; and b) the expiry of not less than 1 months' prior written notice given by the Licensee to the Licensor: if the Licensee does not to give notice to the Licensor the Licence will continue under the terms herewith in. To be clear: to end the Licence the Licensee MUST give one months' prior notice for the Licence end date or the Licence will NOT END and the Licensee will be responsible for the rent until the Licence is ended by either party as detailed herewith in. c) The Licensee may not serve notice to determine (end) in the months of July, December or prior to the 15th of January.

Contrast this with a gift of goods\u2014the person making the gitf gets nothing in return and therefore the gift \u2018transaction\u2019 has no consideration and is not regarded as a binding contract. Of course, the relevance of the distinction between a binding contract and a purely gratuitous exchange is more significant where there is a gap in time between the formation of the contract and the date it is to be performed, as in the next category. \u2022 Bilateral contract made before it is due to be performed, as where A and B make a contract in January for the purchase/supply of grain in August: A\u2019s promise to pay the price is made in exchange for B\u2019s promise to supply the grain\u2014the law regards A\u2019s promise as the consideration for B\u2019s and vice versa. So there is a binding contract in January even though nothing is to be physically handed over until August. (Notice there is no external logic to this principle\u2014A\u2019s promise is only good consideration for B\u2019s because the law regards it as enforceable and therefore of value, and it is only regarded as enforceable because it is supported by consideration.

However, I wish to spread my idea to a few others who may be willing to help me grow the concept and eventually develop it into a real thing. In order to make sure that no one runs off with the idea, I have been considering using an NDA. While these are useful for large software firms with very specific modifications, a few of my changes that I have proposed are on the broader side. Thus, I was hoping that before I gave them the NDA that a few people would be able to look it over and help me determine if the proposed information that would be protected by the NDA is \"too broad/vague.\" Since I will not state the actual information that I am looking to protect with my NDA (for obvious reasons), I will give you the general idea of what I would be trying to protect. The description you hear is on par for both the level of detail and the level of originality the real device has. Imagine it being the same thing as the real one, but with different words. \"My new furnace doesn't use coal like most furnaces, instead, it uses chemical X. Moreover, chemical x is bonded with arsenic and turned into a molten fluid, which allows me to burn up the mixture 50% more efficiently. While molten fluid furnaces have been proposed, they've never used chemical x in them before. Once the chemical x is burnt, helium is bubbled through at pressures around 5,000 psi to get the waste to become a gas, that way it bubbles out. It can react with magnesium to make a solid substance for disposal. Helium is known to react with way with most substances, however, I am the first to apply it to a liquid chemical x-arsenic waste mixture for the purpose of removing it from the furnace. The heat produced by the furnace is taken to a ultra-pressurized sodium gas and sent to a vanadium turbine system. After this turbine system, it immediately goes to whatever needs to be heated up. This process for exchanging heat from the furnace to the target has been used before and is well known, but never when used with a molten fluid furnace before.\" While most of this was not in legalese, it does give the general idea of how much detail I currently have about the design/concept as well as how original the concept is. The thing I would be protecting is how all of these different parts would be used to make chemical x into a usable furnace fuel, not all of the little parts. I would like to stop people from taking my idea of \"using a molten fluid mixture\" for getting heat from chemical x and making their own furnace out of it. Since it is pretty general, I will keep the period to 3-5 years. Thus, would this concept be something that I could protect using a unilateral patent/employee NDA? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Advice if concept is too general for NDA"}

I looked this one up and it said on Quora that you don't really need permission to crawl them since they are present in public domain and are public property. If the websites want privacy, they can change their settings appropriately.

Further, the landowner only realizes the change in tax rate after the renters have completed their stay at the property, but before the security deposit has been returned. Under what conditions is the landlord entitled to deduct the difference in taxes from the security deposit? Additionally, should the difference in taxes exceed the security deposit, can the landlord bill the (now former) tenants the amount in excess? Additional information added in response to comments The 2-page rental agreement contains the following two items under a section Payment Terms. (Identifying information removed.) Security Deposit Your security deposit will be returned to you no later than 4 weeks after your stay to allow for property inspection, damage assessment and receipt of any TV or overseas telephone charges. Rental Fee to be made out to ___ in the amount of ___ and to be received no later than 4 weeks prior to your arrival. The county has imposed a 3% occupancy tax on rentals, payable by renters and forwarded by owners to the County Treasurer. No other information is provided in the Payment Terms section. The issue revolves around the incorrect value of the occupancy tax. Because this item is part of the rental fee, is it an allowable deduction from the security deposit.

Is that idea legally supportable? I think that without the consent of the mother, the existing medical privacy laws (like HIPPA) might make it hard for a real third party to show that a doctor had acted in a way prohibited by the law. It seems like the doctors could mitigate their risk by adding some wording to the surgery consent form I assume they all require. For example, if the doctors required a tick in a checkbox saying \"I have blank medical condition requiring an abortion.\" If someone without a medical condition wants an abortion bad enough, they can lie. If the doctor thinks the lie isn't believable, he refuses to do it.

When this happens, the government then resells the consolidated block of property in the neighborhood to a developer who develops the entire neighborhood and sells the new housing at a much higher price. This has happened multiple times recently in the Greater London area. The risk is greatest when the neighborhood suffers massive real estate value devaluation, which sometimes happens when a neighborhood reaches what is called a \"tipping point\" and starts to decline in value rather than increasing in value. But, is hard to predict whether this will happen. Property owners in these situations are at risk of being forced to sell their property for less than the amount owing on their mortgages if this happens. The question is what legal options a property owner has to limit the risk of this happening by structuring a real estate purchase transaction differently, for example, by purchasing the property with a smaller down payment and a larger mortgage loan balance. End of background It is very difficult to predict the future. But if you buy a flat / house for that matter, in UK, through private purchase, could you insure yourself either given the fact that- you bought the property on mortgage? Or, is there any insurance which could protect you against massive downfall in real estate property values in any unforeseen compulsory purchase situation. Or, is there any way to mitigate this risk / avoid this risk?

It's specific to United States copyright law, just to be clear. Let's say an app author builds a solution that's only to be used by a small, internal group of users. Is it legally possible for the app to have a EULA upon entering the experience that requires any viewer to surrender the rights they may have to any of the content inside the app, if that content is prospectively owned by the user themselves? More specifically, I'll pose a scenario: let's say we're talking about a free app for a private audience, which includes training for the Praxis exam, but potentially also includes example questions taken from official Praxis training materials. Is it possible to have the user agree to a EULA that states they will not file a copyright claim around any content they may discover they actually own rights to, when using the app? If this is indeed legally possible, this seems like a very sticky situation that could open a can of worms: how do you maintain copyright status against media that was stolen, if you can't verify ownership of that media without agreeing to a EULA that nullifies your claim to the rights of said media? \nTITLE: ", "output": "EULA requiring app users to surrender rights to media they didn't upload?"}

While our the landlord handles hiring the exterminator, they have failed to communicate important details that have put mine and my wife's health at risk multiple times. When the exterminator comes to spray, we have to vacate the unit for 4 hours for it to be safe to re-enter. We only found that out because we tried to contact the exterminator's company directly due to the lack of information provided by our landlord. We then contacted the landlord and requested that they inform us once the exterminator has left so we could calculate when it would be safe to return. Not only did they not call us, but the staff member we spoke to said to re-enter \"whenever\" and it \"should be safe\" even if 4 hours hadn't passed yet. After the first spraying, we were told that was it and that they would inspect our unit in two weeks. The next week they put up notices that they would be spraying for general insects. It turns out the exterminator had to do a second spraying (which they said wouldn't happen) and unlike general insect sprays require you not re-enter your unit for 4 hours. If my wife hadn't arrived home early she wouldn't have been able to tell him we weren't prepared and would have returned during the unsafe time period. When we talked to them about the misinformation they were providing us with, the manager laughed at us and told us that it wasn't their job to know those details and that we should \"Google\" the exterminators number and call to learn the details. We have, even before the first visit and each time we were told that because we technically are not the customer they are unable to provide details about our units treatment plan. I want to know if I have legal grounds to break my lease without penalties. I know you can if you have been injured due to negligence by the landlord, but what if they put you at risk multiples times due to negligence by the landlord? So far my wife and I have been able to be proactive enough, and in some cases do the landlords job to the extent that we have remained unharmed so far, but I don't want to be stuck here until we are actually harmed. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Grounds for Breaking a Lease : Health Risks due to Manager"}

The unlawful nature of the stop is not disputed. Al proceeds to search Bob's car without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. The unlawful nature of the search is not disputed. In the trunk of the car, Al finds the dead body of Cal. Cal has been stabbed to death with a knife (also in the trunk) covered in Bob's fingerprints. There is a full account of the murder signed by both Bob and Cal which describes Bob murdering Cal. There are polaroid photos of Bob murdering Cal, also in the trunk. There is no other evidence tying Bob to Cal's murder; no prior history, no eyewitness testimony, no missing persons reports, no indication of where Cal was murdered or why (other than the signed document) and Bob lawyered up and has refused to answer any questions on the grounds he fears self-incrimination. Given these facts are not disputed: would we expect any of this evidence not to be ruled inadmissible if challenged in a criminal trial? assuming the evidence described is ruled inadmissible, what would the law require be returned to Bob? the knife? the pictures and document? the clothes Cal was wearing? Cal's body? would Bob be required to claim ownership of these items to have them returned, or would returning them be the default action? if Bob is required to claim ownership of the items to recover them, and does claim ownership, can that claim of ownership be used in a new trial against Bob? \nTITLE: ", "output": "US exclusionary rule - are there limits?"}

Luckily, these can be acquired en masse today by scraping the web in general or specific sites, such as YouTube. For reproducibility and benchmarking (as well as for sharing expensive resources), it is desirable to publish these data sets so that other researchers can use it, too. There are plenty of corpora like this out there, such as: https://commoncrawl.org/ (basically scrapes the whole written web) or http://moments.csail.mit.edu/ (scraped from various video sites). These sites often have some kind of disclaimer (e.g., do not use for commercial purposes). Also, the content is often curated in some form (e.g., normalized, filtered, trimmed, converted, etc.). Certainly the maintainers of the data set have no individual approval by producers of content and for the ones which use more than one data source, there is also likely no contract with the source platforms. Is this or can this be made legal (the publication of foreign data in such manner) or is it just that no content creator bothers to have their short video removed from a large data set which has likely spread out already anyway (and is accesible publicly anyway)?

I'm tired of it. I want to blow the whistle, but what should I watch out for? Not saying I'm proud of it, but I want to blow the whistle on how it was done. Here are some of the ways I helped do this: Create \"unicorn\" job listings that very few people can actually fill. When a DP applicant applies and is not able to fulfill the strict job requirements, pass them up. However, when a non-DP applicant applies with a satisfactory level of experience and skills, take them. In the event that a DP applicant matches a unicorn role (rare), interview them and require senior-level skills in multiple other disciplines for the role. Ensure that the DP applicant is asked lots of obscure questions unrelated to the job. If they fail on a single question, it's enough to disqualify them from the process. Punish DP candidates who make it through the hiring wall by giving them unrealistic goals and deadlines, and holding them to a much higher standard than everyone else. Usually they'll get fed up and quit, but if they don't we can fire them for \"unsatisfactory performance.\" Never had an issue with constructive dismissals because we stack the \"evidence\" against them from the beginning. Many times we outright fabricate it. If they somehow get past this, we just deny them promotions for various reasons. Create strict \"culture fit\" rules that DP applicants generally can't fit into, and pass them up based on \"not a cultural fit\" reasons. These controls basically ensure DP applicants never really get a chance, and if they do, everything is stacked against them. It helps the companies save lots of money on accommodations, and prevents a significant amount of lawsuits. I've helped successfully defend against multiple EEOC lawsuits simply by showing the candidate was not qualified for the position, or didn't perform their job well enough. Either we stack the evidence against them from the beginning, or outright fabricate it. \nTITLE: ", "output": "How do I blow the whistle for discrimination that I'm part of and partially responsible for?"}

That means Members elect a Board of Directors. The Members, naturally, need to be able to freely discuss the affairs of the organization (corporation) so they can discuss amongst themselves which directors to elect. The seated Board of Directors might have feelings about this, and might want to interfere. In support of this, the State (MI) has statute obliging the organization to give Members the tools to campaign. They \"shall provide a reasonable way for Members to communicate regarding the affairs of the corporation\". The organization has provided the member list. Instead the Board of Directors place absurd limitations on speech: \"You can't talk about money, can't name individuals, can't disparage anyone or make implications, can't say X, Y, Z\". These effectively gag the Members from having any meaningful communication. This defeats the purpose of the State law which guarantees right to communicate. The statute seems silent on whether Member speech is free. I need to find case law (any state will do) where the Board of Directors or managers tried to block free speech or access to the Member list, it went to verdict, and the judge made some sort of ruling on the question of either list access or speech limitations.

I am aware that many of these debt collectors often don't get much information to go on. They buy the debt (at a very low cost) and often very little information is included with that debt, perhaps just an email address, phone number and potentially an old address. This can sometimes make it very hard for these debt collectors to identify individuals. Which got me wondering what happens if they cannot actually identify someone? Of course, the obvious answer is that they would eventually try and obtain a County Court Judgement against the individual. However, my understanding is that for a CCJ to be valid/acceptable they have to reasonably know that the individual is at the given address.

In the case that they were seized in the commission of a felony, there was no question that sufficient evidence existed to justify an arraignment. Formerly if a person was NOT apprehended in the commission of a felony, but was merely a suspect, then the authorities had to INDICT the suspect to prove sufficient evidence. Even after the person was indicted, they would still not be arrested, they would simply be summoned to court. A person would only be arrested if they failed to appear, in which case a warrant for their arrest would be issued by the court. Now, of course, this standard procedure has been abandoned. The police now seize and arrest anyone they plan to charge without warrant and the indictment is sought AFTER they have arrested the person. Obviously the police desire to arrest the suspect because that gives them the opportunity to humiliate the suspect and interrogate them to collect more evidence. Also, a suspect in prison will have a much harder time defending themselves at an arraignment or resisting an indictment. So, what exactly is the legal principle under which the police consider themselves to be authorized to arrest and imprison people before they have been indicted? Note that this question, to repeat the above, only applies to people who have not been apprehended in the act of committing a crime (in flagrante delicto) and are suspects by virtue of some subsequent investigation. For example, let's imagine (and this is a real example) a store complains they were shoplifted (grand larceny) and provide photos of the suspect. The police, then by computer matching of the photos to mugshots, have a suspect. They then go and arrest the suspect without indicting him first (in corpore delicti). In the old days, this would have constituted a false arrest because the suspect was not caught in the act. Now, however, the police routinely arrest people like this for felonies after the fact without indicting them or otherwise proving in court that (1) a crime has actually been committed, and (2) that they have sufficient evidence to bring the person to trial. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Legal basis for arresting a person not actively committing a crime?"}

My question is: Are priests held to the same standard? Can a judge (federal, state, etc.) order a priest to sit in front of a grand jury and disclose what was said in confession?

Where does the burden of proof lie? I have a device that would no longer charge. I could see inside the port that something wasn't right i.e. the pins had lifted. I know that I haven't misused the device and feel that I did nothing to cause this damage. The company in question have told me that this is a chargeable repair as pins are broken. Is it their right to assume that I broke the device and refuse the repair? The cost to repair is \u00a350 so I am not going to take lengthy legal process against them over this. However would tt be the case that their 'proof' is that a pin can't break/bend by itself so me plugging in the charger was clearly the cause, even though that is using the product as intended? I had a device that was overheating it was repaired without question, even though theoretically the heat could have been caused by it being inside a TV unit with poor airflow. So in the UK are companies allowed to refuse a warranty repair without any proof other than their own assumption?

Imagine walking up to Starbucks dragging along a 1st and 3rd grader and running into streaming porn on laptops throughout the store. Not that they would allow it but, you get the idea. So my question Is it legal in the US to watch pornography in public places? I imagine this may trail out into state laws and skip Federal altogether but I seem to remember Larry Flint having a Supreme Court victory related to pornography sales and Hustler magazine as a product being visible to potential consumers in stores. So there's that. Edit Regarding localization to US States and commentary to that effect. This is a Federal question. This seems to pertain. Flynt vs Fallwell in the Supreme Court regarding the 1st Amendment. Flynt won regarding the display and definition of pornography vs expression. This addition doesn't change the question, it simply justifies it as a Federal question rather than one for the States as this is primarily a Constitutional issue. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Is it legal in the US to watch pornography in public places?"}

How the insurer arrived at the \"corrections\" is a separate issue. What I am disputing is the number of vehicles used in the \"average\". Essentially, I am arguing that they need to account for confidence limits in their calculation of the average. If they are averaging only three values of, say, $9,000, $10,000, and $8,000, it is possible that if they pick 3 other vehicles with values of $15,000, $20,000, and $10,000, they would get a much different result. The 95% upper confidence limit on the mean is the sample mean plus around twice the sample standard deviation of the samples presented. For the first example above, the sample average is $9,000 and the sample standard deviation is $817. Thus I would argue that a more accurate estimate of the average value is $9,000 + $1,600 ($10,600), not the straight sample average of $9,000 that they are proposing. Is there any precedent for this kind of argument in any Texas or Federal Courts? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Disputing \"average value\" for insurance total losses"}

What counts as \"fixing in a tangible medium\" for a digital document? Is it enough to save a copy of the file to a local, private disk, or must said file be made available to another person (e.g. via publication on the internet)? To make this concrete, let's suppose Alice has a version control repository (such as Git), which is initially private and is later made public. In the USA, at what point does the contents of the repository become subject to copyright? (Assuming that the contents are of a type of material eligible for copyright.) Consider the following hypothetical timeline: 2010: Alice initializes a Git repository. It is initially empty and is stored only on Alice's local computer. 2011: Alice creates and adds file A to the repository. (The repository is still private.) 2012: Alice creates and adds file B to the repository. (Again private.) 2013: Alice makes the repository publicly available. 2014: Alice adds file C to the repository (which is now public, so the file is published immediately). Now, what is the correct copyright year to apply to each file in the repository? (Let's assume the files are not modified after they are added. Let's also suppose that the version control system metadata, including timestamps, is correct and hasn't been altered.) For file C, the answer is fairly obvious: the file was created, added, and published in 2014, so the copyright date has to be 2014. For A and B, the answer isn't so obvious. I used to think the answer was 2013, since that was the time at which the files were made publicly available. However, I recently talked to a laywer about the case of a physical document which is later published, and said laywer (though not providing legal advice) said the copyright date would be the time at which that physical document was created, rather than published (since at the time of creation, it is already fixed in a tangible medium, even if it hasn't yet been published). If that is true, the copyright dates for A and B would have to be 2011 and 2012, respectively, since that is when those files are authored and created. \nTITLE: ", "output": "When does a digital document become subject to copyright?"}

According to \"An artist\u2019s guide to copyrights\" by Laura Levin-Dando: a broad range of creative works, such as photographs, visual art, audio recordings, sheet music, novels, and screenplays. If you expended creative effort to make something, you created it independently without copying someone else\u2019s work, and it is embodied in a physical format Therefore, things that deemed to lack creative value or are facts (phone numbers) cannot be copyrighted. Where does this leave sequence of characters like digital signatures or hashes? They arguably don't have artistic value on its own - while they are unique, it just machine-generated sequence of bytes. It would be different if, for example, you used bunch of existing or valid hashes to compose them in ASCII art - but it would protect that piece of ASCII art only, wouldnt it? Plus, from my point of view - they are factual things. Windows.dll version 1.0.2.003 has md5hash aea603dba12c6e23b7b0ab9db4f81120 - this is a fact. A file, containing list of hashes for list of files is not copyright protected on its own, even if it is a part of something which partially protected by copyright (software, video game).

Police quickly gather around Bob to begin stalling for time by keeping Bob occupied by questioning him while the VIP politician had time to get away while spared the nuisance of being reminded how much the human race loathes him. The police seem to be going for an angle of justifying this interference by pretending to be treating it as a potential public order offence which they haven't yet certainly ascertained the commission or non commission of despite undeniably fully understanding that nothing of a sort that would even make it to, much less stand up in court had been done or uttered. The senior officer having gotten Bob's side of the story then disappears to get other nearby witnesses' versions of events while some more junior officers stay with Bob asking for his details like full name and date of birth which Bob willingly gives them. The crux of the question is, the senior officer's MO seemed to be to be as unobtrusive as he could justify, that is to say he first wanted to ascertain the facts that were the reason for his potential interest in the various individuals involved before being concerned about their identities. Presumably if it had been determined that no offence had been committed, then he wouldn't have cared about Bob's identity.

In New Zealand the procedure is set out in r 9.36 and the following rules. Court experts can be appointed both on an application by a party and on the court's own volition. As explained in McGechan on Procedure: The procedure has not been widely used, probably because it goes against the traditionally adversarial way in which litigation has been conducted: each party would rather bring along its own expert, hoping to discredit the other's expert in cross-examination, but ultimately leaving it to the Court to choose between them. Appointment of a single expert by the Court has the advantage of possibly resolving a significant issue without the need for any evidence at all. (Interestingly, what a court expert tells is not considered evidence \u2014 unlike if it was a regular expert witness). In nut shell, if a party wants the court to appoint a court expert, the party first needs to try to reach an agreement with the other parties on whom to appoint. Ultimately the court will decide who it will be (if anyone) from the list of candidates proposed by the parties. What is vague to me is whether the expert has to agree to be appointed. In case of regular expert witnesses they obviously are free to appear or not. But is it he same with court experts? Can a party simply nominate experts they wish to hear and apply to the court for their appointment, without even contacting them beforehand? Or does the party need to obtain the proposed experts' consent first?

Section 504 spelled the beginning of the end of \"separate but equal\" for people with disabilities.

At trial, a human director of the defendant is called by the defendant party as a witness, but the defendant itself is represented now by a barrister. If one wishes to reference claims or points made (I suppose nonetheless by the defendant, even if through its human solicitor) in pre-trial correspondence, these challenges couldn't necessarily be posed to the human director of the defendant in cross-examination, because the human director of the defendant is not actually the defendant itself, while the barrister will also not have been the one who had written the letters of correspondence (it would have been the solicitor). If one wishes to quiz or challenge the defendant, what opportunities in trial are there to do this? Even if we suppose momentarily that the legal representative of the defendant for the trial was the same one who had been writing all of the letters of pre-trial correspondence (ie the solicitor), as the legal representative is not a witness who can be subjective to cross-examination, are there any opportunities in a trial to enter into socratic, examination-style dialogue with the other side's representative?

This is not the scenario in the aforementioned case. If a camera is pointed out into a public street on a cul-de-sac, and the field of view covers a line right across the road, so that anybody living at the end of the cul-de-sac has no option but to pass through it when leaving or returning, would that infringe on the same right?

The background is that Terry Farrell, an actress on the series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, left the show on bad terms after the sixth season. The following year, the series finale featured several montages of clips from old episodes, but Farrell's character was notably absent, despite her long involvement with the show. When asked about the reasons for this, pretty much everyone agrees that it was a matter of permission; they needed Farrell's permission to use the clips, and couldn't get it. In the words of Ronald D. Moore, one of the show's main writers: In order to use a clip of someone from a previous episode, you first have to obtain permission from the actor in question. I'm inclined to take Moore at his word, since he is involved in the industry and I am not, but I was surprised to read this; I would have thought the studio would retain full rights to use their old episodes in any way they see fit. So, I was hoping Law.SE could help clarify my understanding. What legal grounds (if any) are behind this requirement? Aside: since I have only a passing familiarity with the legal profession, plain English explanations of any citations is greatly appreciated \nTITLE: ", "output": "Why do television actors have to give permission for the use of old footage of their characters?"}
{"input": "Generate a concise, engaging title for the following legal question on an internet forum. The title should be legally relevant, capture key aspects of the issue, and entice readers to learn more. \nQUESTION: I'm curious about this video (TYRANT ALERT PHOTOG ATTACKED BY FEDERAL AGENTS - MICHAEL HODSON U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL) of a federal LEO (law enforcement officer) who is egregiously assaulting/battering a citizen without even a legal pretense. He did so both on the federally managed grounds and on the ME easement. My questions regard the legal limitations and boundaries of a LEO's jurisdiction and how criminal conduct color the rules for jurisdiction. When the LEO violently assaulted the citizen on the easement is he out of his jurisdiction? Suppose for the sake of argument, the LEO has jurisdiction limited to the property with the easement in question. Under the general question of where or not jurisdiction ends in an easement a few specific questions come to mind: If a LEO acts entirely on the easement, due to events that happened entirely on the easement, does that have any impact on the legal authority of the LEO? Is there any immediate or long term legal consequence for an officer committing crimes or doing so egregiously (with or without qualified immunity) while out of his jurisdiction as opposed to doing so in his jurisdiction? For instance, could a civilian defend himself against violent assaults from an officer while out of the LEO's jurisdiction that he could not legally defend himself from while the LEO were fully in his jurisdiction? Are other officers bound by law to arrest or stop other officers committing crimes outside of the jurisdiction when they are normally allowed discretion to allow fellow officers to flout the law? Does an officer loose the qualified immunity defense or other legal defense when doing illegal things out of his jurisdiction? Are there any important nuances to jurisdiction and law enforcement by LEOs that a first amendment auditor should be aware of? *** VIDEO CONTEXT The video show a first amendment auditor and legal activist taking video of a federal facility, U.S. customs and border patrol. Before he can enter the facility or say a word to anyone he is threatened by his soon-to-be asailaint, a federal LEO. I know this is illegal for the LEO to do, and so does the first amendment auditor. This is a matter of clearly established law. At this point it is likely only a civil matter because the officer has given prior restraint to limit the auditor's clearly established legal rights. The auditor says \"Don't touch me!\", then the belligerent LEO repeatedly shoves, slaps, and threatens with frightening words. While the assaults/batteries happen the auditor is trying to explain the law and give notice of the DHS memo that verifies the auditor's right to record and then he threatens legal action with phrases like 'You're going to get fired/loose qualified immunity/etc for this!' I'm taking it for granted that the cop knowingly broke the law even before the easement. Certainly, he should have known. It seems like a civil matter at this point, before the easement, because cops are given special privileges while on duty that allow them to commit certain crimes without obstruction from civilians. *I'm not merely saying cops are legally allowed to do things that civilians cannot legally do. * I'm also suggesting that cops effectively can break the laws even they are under, as there are often laws against resisting an unlawful arrest even if this is a privilege to temporarily break the law it is nonetheless permission to break the law in often egregious ways at least while acting under the color of law. As other officers witnessing the crimes of fellow LEOs often have discretion, this is effectively a license to commit crime at least for a while. I'm not debating the merits of this, but merely stating what I believe to be relevant facts leading up the question of whether or not civilians can ever restrain criminally acting violent LEOs in any lawful way in the context of easement law. The LEO went beyond what is his normal lawful jurisdiction for protecting against criminals not just by committing crimes himself, but by going into the easement of the property and into the public street. He pushed the auditor into the public street or highway - I can't tell which. He then threw the auditors equipment into the street. The auditor claimed this easement was not his lawful jurisdiction. So now I'm interested to know if any LEO is ever restricted in jurisdiction by an easement in any way and if federal LEOs like this one, who are normally restricted to enforcing laws on a property, are restricted in any way by easement laws. As a concrete example related to the video content, could this LEO observe a person peacefully walking along the easement and then shove him into traffic while having the full protection of laws that prohibit obstruction of unlawful officer action or could the auditor or civilian observers legally have defended the auditor in this simplified example by responding in kind by for instance restraining the belligerent LEO? For the sake of understanding the law, let's consider just the example of an auditor that was on the easement of the property the LEO has jurisdiction on but not ever beyond that. DISCLAIMERS: I'm not asking about the violent assault while within his jurisdiction except to contrast to the assault within his jurisdiction. I'm not asking what is prudent for either an average citizen or a seasoned first amendment auditor and legal activist to do in this situation. These are rather questions of de jure law. I'm not asking about the jurisdiction for a citizen to effect a legal citizens arrest. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Does the jurisdiction of a LEO end at an easement?"}

My understanding is that if you go to court with someone over a contract, the case is not tried by a jury. But, can the law still be overridden in the interest of justice? For instance, imagine a scenario where a A brings in his car for repairs. The mechanic B charges him twice as much as agreed for it, and when A complains he points to some fine print in the contract that A didn't notice when he signed it, which says his prices will be twice what is agreed on tuesdays between 3 and 5pm, and look at that: A brought in his car at 3:05! So while B is technically correct, it is entirely plausible that a jury might look at this and say: hang on, that's clearly absurd, you can't go around charging people more because they didn't notice your cleverly worded loophole. Except, that since this is a civil case, there's no jury. So, is a judge allowed to say that? You may disagree with my specific example, but hopefully you get the point: I'm asking whether it is possible for a court without a jury to rule against the technical interpretation of a law, if they determine that following the letter of it would in this single case by unjust, or contrary to the spirit. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Can jury nullification apply to a civil lawsuit?"}

All the physical assets were sold off. I don't want to reveal the company's name, but they were in a very unique industry and acquired a significant amount of industry specific data over the years. This information is very valuable to other people in the industry. It recently came to my attention that several other people in the industry have copies of this information/data.

Does the owner of the bankrupt business have any rights to the intellectual property? I was told by someone that since the data belonged to the bankrupt company it was \"public knowledge\". That just doesn't seem right to me. If anyone can shed some light on this issue I would really appreciate it.

Among other things, it requires banks to report large currency transactions in excess of $10,000 to the Justice Department. In 1970, $10,000 was a lot of money -- enough to buy a house in some parts of the country. In 2017, however, an average financially disciplined middle-class family could easily have that much in savings. This is tempered somewhat by the fact that in our modern age most large transactions are now done electronically rather than with giant bags of money. Recently, I came into a windfall. A fat tax return, combined with money from a legal settlement, a cashout of PTO at work, a lot of overtime on my last paycheck, plus the amount I already had in savings has netted more money in my bank account than I've ever had at one time in my life. I'd like to take pictures of this event, since it's all going to pay off debt very shortly :-) What I would like to do is withdraw all of this money in $20 bills, carry it out of the bank in a big bag with a '$' sign on it, spread it all out on my bed, and roll around in it Scrooge McDuck style. I would of course take it back to the bank promptly, because you really shouldn't have that much cash just laying around. My question is, what kind of harassment, if any, could I expect from the government or the bank about that? Would it put me on some kind of watch list or start a covert investigation on me?

In June, some students who returned to the dorm early saw some male teachers exiting their rooms. They reportedly ran back to the school building without answering any questions when they saw the students. That night, multiple students shared that their drawers were seemingly searched and in some cases underwear and other things were missing. In the monthly school meeting the search became the main topic. Eventually a high-ranking teacher attempted to clarify what happened. He claimed that they \"had suspicion\" that someone was hiding illegal firearms in their room, but they could not narrow it down so they had to search all the rooms, both the boys' and the girls'. They declined to explain any further on the reasoning behind the suspicion and merely added they reported it to the police and received permission. The session was then dismissed much earlier than usual. The speaker was visibly shaking so I doubted that was the real reason. The distrust only grew when we contacted the local police and an officer told us that they never received such report from our school. The rhetoric has changed ever since. Here is a non-exhaustive list of excuses they came up to cover up the situation. Local police authorized search due to firearm suspicions - debunked, never alerted the police A majority of all students agreed to the search - debunked, no school-wide poll The student council unanimously agreed to the search - debunked, no such topic was discussed A majority of all parents agreed to the search - debunked, no such notice to parents A majority of parents in the school board agreed to the search - debunked, never happened The teachers were substituting dorm workers on vacation to fix dorm equipment - debunked, workers were present The list goes on and on and I find it pathetic that they are still not apologizing even though two months have passed and we are in vacation.

Valid registration plate. b. A current certificate of inspection. c. An ascertainable vehicle identification number. There are two possible meanings of this phrase: The vehicle does not bear (a), does not bear (b), and does not bear (c). The vehicle does not bear all of (a), (b), and (c); in other words, the answer to \"Does it bear all of the following?\" would be \"No\". Now, I am guessing they mean (2), because vehicles are usually supposed to have all three of these things. However my question is not about this specific case, but about the legal terminology: Is there an accepted unambiguous understanding of this phrase in law? Which of (1) and (2) would be correct? \nTITLE: ", "output": "What is the legal interpretation of \"does not bear all of the following\"?"}

And then it says: Article III of the Constitution requires federal criminal trials to be held in the state in which the crime was committed. And the Sixth Amendment entitles a federal criminal defendant to a trial by jurors living in the state and district where the crime was committed. But if someone committed a crime in the uninhabited Idaho portion of Yellowstone, Kalt surmised, it would be impossible to form a jury. And being federal land, the state would have no jurisdiction.

This question is not about this. I'm also familiar with professional Codes of Ethics that gain \"legal\" force by virtue of contract law and/or incorporation into professional regulatory statutes, but generally only apply to certified or licensed professionals (e.g. non-physicians do not incur liability by behaving in ways that are inconsistent with contemporary medical ethics but are otherwise lawful). This question is not about this either. Has US law ever imposed a general duty on the general public to behave ethically? Restated, has a court ever imposed liability on a private citizen (holding no professional licensure or certification, holding no public office, etc.) for behavior that did not violate any specific provision of criminal or civil law, but rather transgressed either normative community ethics or the court's view as to what such ethics ought to be? I used to think that it would be absurd for there to be \"purely ethical\" liability, but I found this article by an attorney in Arizona, who seems to be primarily talking about professional ethics (not general citizen ethics), but states that a court could theoretically punish on the basis of transgressing an ethical rule that has broad community acceptance but that had not been formally accepted by or imposed on the defendant by specific legal process.

Over 4 years of probation while living there the parents become extremely toxic and abusive to the woman (their daughter). Then the father passes away and the mother freaks out because she has no income anymore. Daughter offers mother money for rent (has been living there without paying any rent for years) but instead mother tries to force daughter into homelessness in order to move in another person (other daughter) and kick out daughter #1. Daughter and husband and kids move out for three weeks because mother threw a temper tantrum and left the house and daughter wants mom to be able to come back. In that amount of time, daughter gets kicked out of new place due to conduct of husband and mother in law. Daughter comes back to parents' house with a fake permission from mother in law who claims that she talked to the mom.

One of the sections is particularly unbelievable to me: Security and Charge 14.1 In consideration of the Supplier agreeing to supply the Goods, the Client charges all of its rights, title and interest (whether joint or several) in any land, realty or other assets capable of being charged, owned by the Client either now or in the future, to secure the performance by the Client of its obligations under these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, the payment of any money). 14.2 The Client indemnifies the Supplier from and against all the Supplier\u2019s costs and disbursements including legal costs on a solicitor and own client basis incurred in exercising the Supplier\u2019s rights under this clause. 14.3 The Client irrevocably appoints the Supplier and each director of the Supplier as the Client\u2019s true and lawful attorney/s to perform all necessary acts to give effect to the provisions of this clause 14 including, but not limited to, signing any document on the Client\u2019s behalf. I have googled some of the text and it appears to be pretty common. I don't completely understand the use of the word \"charge\" here, but am I correct in interpreting this to mean that the supplier can claim my assets if I fail to fulfill my responsibilities, and that if I have a dispute with them, I can't have my own legal representation because I've agreed that the supplier will be my attorney, and that - most egregiously - the supplier can write whatever they want and then sign it on my behalf?

No Objection To Title The Tenant must assume the Landlords' right to grant the tenancy; shall not require any evidence of the Landlords' title to the Premises; or raise any objection, requisition or enquiry in respect of it. What else are the worst that can happen to me, if I agree? I know Canadian law's different, but I found one pitfall in this PDF by Louis-Martin Dub\u00e9 LL.B. from Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (1985), Partner at McCarthy Tetrault, The Tenant, the Landlord and his Mortgage Lender: Is Three a Crowd? As for the tenant, he will want to protect his right to occupy the leased premises and avoid any risk of termination of the lease should the landlord be in default with his lender. Isn't this clause too onerous? Isn't it unconscionable and unreasonable to require the Tenant to deliberately ignore any encumbrances on the Landlord's title? \nTITLE: ", "output": "How else can the Tenant lose out, if Tenant agrees not to object to Landlord's title, and assumes Landlords' right to grant the tenancy?"}

The GDPR considers an IP address \"personal data\" that is subject to the GDPR. The GDPR requires consent of the subject for collection or storage of personal data (in this case, IP addresses in a log file). How is a website owner supposed to acquire consent by way of the website if the very act of visiting the website page to acquire consent records the \"personal data\" about which consent is being granted? Obviously, the option is available to website owners to configure their webservers not to log IP addresses, but that has security implications. Do these security concerns suffice to absolve a website owner from requiring consent to log IP addresses? Is a prominent notice (on every page, until dismissed) sufficient? How is the GDPR supposed to be interpreted with respect to the extremely common and prevalant practice of IP address logging? (I have read Would GDPR affect my own personal website? and the answers at the time of this writing are not sufficiently satisfactory. Article 6, paragraph 1 does not make the question of automatic IP address logging without explicit consent clearly acceptable or not. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN ) \nTITLE: ", "output": "How to satisfy GDPR's consent requirement for IP logging?"}

Of the armed, professional guards its maybe 10x higher. An average life insurance policy is $100 per month for a 30 year old, with a about a 0.001% monthly risk of death. That means, scaled for risk of death, a security guard would need 100x more or $10,000 a month life insurance. This is obviously far excess of their wage. Since security guards are basically irrational and dont adequately value their lives, is it fraud for them to take out a life insurance policy? Not that they would, but if a security company took out policies for security guards would it basically either be impossible or a fraud conspiracy, given their risk of death is so under priced? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Life insurance for security guards"}

According to their terms, once you get acquainted with a pet care provider through Wag! platform, you cannot obtain for life pet care services from the dog sitter, off their platform. If you do, Wag! can charge your card a $1,000 referral fee and the same applies to the dog sitter. EDIT Note that the mentioned contract provision has no expiration. You are subject to $1,000 payment whenever during your lifetime you should happen to ask for a pet care service to someone met through Wag!. Is this legal? The provision is akin to a non-compete clause where the dog sitter agrees not to start a separate business in competition against their employer. In that case $1,000 qualifies as a compensation for breaching the agreement. However dog sitters (like Uber drivers) are not Wag! employees, and by the way these clauses are not permissible in all jurisdictions. This is might be the reason they use the term 'referral fee', anyway, the fee is many times more the value of the referred pet-care services: imagine to pay $10,000 for a second hand car and $50,000 for someone helping finding the seller. It is reasonable to assume nobody would willingly accept to pay such a huge fee and the only reason to enter the contract is the misrepresentation of the associated costs.

I was unaware that there was a school zone because as I was traveling in the left lane there was a rolling road block of several trucks that were turning onto a street right after the sign. The sign is a flashing light that says \"speed limit 25 when flashing\" and I had no knowledge the sign existed because it was impossible to have seen it with the trucks that obstructed it from my view. Is there any case law about this or what would I say to the judge to explain that I am not liable as it was not possible to have known due to the sign being blocked. After I was ticketed I went into the neighborhood and found the trucks (there were several large moving trucks, so I had reason to believe they were still there loading or unloading) and I took a picture showing them and also the street sign was in the picture showing the location. I also had another person in a different vehicle several hundred feet behind me that was able to see the sign and was a witness to the trucks creating a rolling road block. This is in Michigan if it makes a difference. Thanks! Edit: The road I was traveling on the speed limit is 45mph which is what I was doing. There was a single sign that flashes a light only when the school zone is in effect. There was no reason to believe it was not \"prudent\" to travel at 45. There was also no reason to believe there was a school zone as it was impossible to see the ONLY sign indicating such. I have a witness traveling behind me that can contest to the inability to see such a sign and I went back and took pictures of the moving trucks in the neighborhood to show what it was that prevented me from seeing the sign. The only way for anyone to know there was a school zone in effect was seeing a flashing light which was not visible with the trucks traveling next to me. By rolling road block I did not mean any sort of construction vehicle or anything such that would warn of any changes or anything. It was simply several trucks in the right lane which obstructed my view of a sign on the other side of the trucks. Not like the trucks that have flashing lights behind workers filling potholes or anything.

I'm from the UK, where generally speaking filming in court is not allowed, and I find the setup somewhat confusing. I know filming/broadcasting court cases is often allowed in the US (I guess the OJ Simpson trial is a classic example), presumably because there's an argument that they are a public event, which seems reasonable from one perspective. In this particular case, though, it seems like a specific program is being produced by Judge Caprio and colleagues - there are cutaway segments where he and other regular characters talk about / introduce cases, etc. - it's editiorialized in such a way that it seems he is presenting his court as a show. Isn't there an argument that he personally might profit from this, and this or his reptutation might sway his decisions / cause him to present things in a particular light? How is this allowed by ethics rules that presumably the judge is bound to follow? In effect, it seems like some defendants are being forced to appear on a TV show. Note I'm not specifically saying that's true of Judge Caprio; in fact, I find the show fascinating, I learn a lot, and I think his general message of compassion is admirable. But one could imagine less ethical judges abusing this (\"America's Worst Criminals\").

Further, from the official website: Judge Frank Caprio is the Chief Municipal Judge in Providence, Rhode Island and former Chairman of the Rhode Island Board of Governors.

I would mimic their exact API (package, class, and method names) except replacing the trademarked word \u201cjava\u201d. The source code taken from the OpenJDK project for Java SE 8 would be used as a guide to write the equivalent as closely as possible line-by-line in the other language. All of this would be made publicly available easily on a source-code sharing site such as BitBucket.com or GitHub.com. These files would include the necessary prominent notices and licenses statements as required by the GPL. As an example, the source code from java.util.HashMap. The Gnu.org FAQ, What does the GPL say about translating some code to a different programming language? says that translation to another programming language is treated like other modifications, acceptable if all terms of GPL are met. I would have thought the GPL\u2019s very purpose is to allow such freedom. My confusion stems from the Oracle versus Google appeal ruling of 2014-05-09 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Court. That ruling upholds copyrightability of an API, which I can understand. What I do not understand is why that copyrightability issue is relevant given the source code is available under the GPL. I suppose their are two core parts to my question: Is the GPL rendered impotent if the original publishers decides to pursue a claim of copyright violation against anyone forking or imitating their GPL-licensed work? How can Oracle claim damages from infringing copyright on code published under the GPL? Is there any other restriction beyond the terms of the GPL that would bar me from producing an open-source rewrite/translation of a Java (OpenJDK) library in another programming language? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Is it legal to rewrite a Java (OpenJDK) library into another programming language under GPL?"}

The most common mistakes students make when explaining or applying the law on technical assault are: confusing fear with apprehension (see \u2018The main issues\u2019, above); confusing an immediate apprehension with an apprehension of immediate harm, so: \u2013 if V says \u2018I now expect to be hit tomorrow\u2019, there is no technical assault (even if V is very afraid of the future harm), but \u2013 if V says \u2018I expect now to be hit now, but I am not afraid\u2019, the actus reus of a technical assault is satisfied. Do not forget to consider if D satisfies the mens rea too; \u2013 if V says \u2018I am not sure when I will be hit: it may be tomorrow or it might be now\u2019 that can be an assault according to Constanza [1997] because the victim fears they might be hit in the immediate future. Herring, Criminal Law: Text, Cases, and Materials (8 edn, 2018). p. 75 What does \u2018imminent\u2019 mean? The victim\u2019s apprehension must be of imminent harm. It is well established that a threat to be violent in the distant future (e.g. \u2018I will beat you up next week\u2019) is not an assault.13 But what about a threat to cause violence in the near future? Lord Steyn in Ireland indicated that a fear of violence \u2018within a minute or two\u2019 might be sufficient to constitute an assault.14 This leaves open the question of exactly where the line is to be drawn: is fear of violence in ten minutes enough, an hour, a day? We can know only when we have further guidance from the courts. ... ... 13 But there are some specific offences that relate to threats to harm in the future, e.g. there is an offence of threatening to kill in the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, s. 16. 14 See also Smith v Superintendent of Woking Police Station (1983) 76 Cr App R 234.

I am running into an issue on sewer line access. Originally (1932) the plots of me and my neighbor were not divided as they are now. Apparently both existing hookups to the sewer are in between my front yard and the street. My house was built in 2006, after acquiring one plot from the neighbor's estate and combining it with another plot. At the time, a new sewer-line was put in for the house and no easement was written up. The house that was on neighbor's plot was from 1941, extremely dilapidated, and occasionally abandoned for up to 8 months at a time. The property was sold at the end 2013 and the house was demolished. Then a new house was erected on the site, where the building permit makes no mention of sewer access. Does the previous sewer attachment running through my property likely grant the current owner/construction the right to dig through my property to reconnect the new house on the old connection? I've been reading through much of O.C.G.A. TITLE 44 Chapter 9 and wasn't able to find much that might seemed immediately relevant. Is there a better place to look? Perhaps I need to try to find more county regulations (which I had a hard time finding digital copies of). I was a little interested in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-9-6 because there were several occasions where the property was vacant for 6+ months, including a 7-month pause in demolition construction due to funding, but after trying to find some case law I don't think that's long enough (as 44-9-6 doesn't specify a time, it seemed vague to me). Hopefully you will forgive if I'm not even asking this question correctly, but I'm trying to read up on relevant Georgia code so I can understand the situation from a legal perspective. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Right of way on new construction when easement was never established?"}

The alleged constitutional violation creates a cause of action that is distinct from any otherwise available state tort remedy. \u201cConstitutional tort\u201d is a predominantly academic term originating in the aftermath of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Monroe v. Pape (1961), which held that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides a separate federal remedy for individuals suing state or municipal government officers who have violated their constitutional rights. The term is also used in the context of Bivens actions, which are lawsuits under federal common law for constitutional violations committed by federal government employees. As with common law torts, the usual remedy for constitutional torts is monetary damages. https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/constitutional_tort While I think the definition is comparing \u00a7 1983 with \u201cBivens actions.\u201d Are there specific laws regarding Bivens?

Stat. \u00a7 2C:45-1.b.(6), one of the standard terms of criminal probation that may be imposed in New Jersey is: To refrain from frequenting unlawful or disreputable places or consorting with disreputable persons; I'm having a little difficulty understanding what criteria would have to be met for a person to be considered \"disreputable\" enough for probationers in New Jersey to be obligated to avoid \"consorting\" with them. The term does not appear to be defined in New Jersey statutes. It (or similar phraseology) appears in the statutes of some other jurisdictions, so I suspect that it is a legal term of art with a specific meaning rather than a vague admonition against socializing or doing business with the kinds of people that my parents warned me about. The most obvious and reasonable definition would be someone with a criminal record, but if that is the case, it would make more sense for the statute to just come out and say it rather than use a less clear term. It would also be unclear if any criminal record qualifies a person as being disreputable or if the determination is based on the recency and/or severity of the criminal conduct (e.g. multiple felony sexual assaults of a child in the past year versus one misdemeanor expired fishing license rap from 1972). What is the definition of a \"disreputable person\" under New Jersey law? Specifically, is it defined in terms of objective criteria (e.g. more than X felony convictions in the past Y years) or is it based on a subjective (\"whole person\") analysis with multiple areas of inquiry (e.g. criminal record, general attitude, personality traits, credit rating, history of losing civil lawsuits, professional ethics violations not amounting to criminal conduct, whether they are currently suspended from Law Stack Exchange, life accomplishments, neighborhood rumor and gossip, etc.)? To be clear, I am asking if this term is defined or has a generally accepted legal meaning, not asking for personal advice. I am not personally on probation in New Jersey, and if I was, I would address this question to my lawyer and/or probation officer rather than the Internet. If this term has been defined in another jurisdiction under circumstances where a New Jersey court would be likely to adopt a similar definition, I would accept that as an answer. An answer might look something like this: In the New Jersey Supreme Court case Smith v. State [cite], \"disreputable person\" was defined as any person with two or more felony convictions in the past ten years or who was convicted of an offense requiring sex offender registration regardless of how long ago. It was specifically held that evidence that Probationer's consort had had his nursing license revoked for professional misconduct six months prior to consorting with Probationer was entirely irrelevant and inadmissible as evidence of disreputability for purposes of revocation as no criminal conviction had resulted from said conduct. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Who qualifies as a \"disreputable person\" for purposes of probation?"}

So half of it is about giving the users more control over their personal data, and the other half seems to be related to INFOSEC and its best practices. It seems you have to comply with a list of \"best practices\" and document everything you do to be able to demonstrate that you are indeed protecting the user's data, although those \"best practices\" are just very vague guidelines or comments based on possible interpretations of the law (at least for now). But if that is the way it is, then will the all-too-common sloppy practices in security suddenly become illegal? For example, I don't think there is now a law that makes it mandatory to keep your website updated (think of CMS's like Wordpress or Drupal, or frameworks like Laravel, etc), but with GDPR if you have a Wordpress blog with subscribers then names, hashed passwords, emails, and maybe other personal data will end up in your database and you will have to take the necessary steps to protect that data. This means that if you don't keep your Wordpress up to date, you are breaking GDPR. And the same would appear to be true of a lot of other very common bad practices. Not having HTTPS is not considered illegal now as far as I know (unless you need to process credit-card data directly on your website, maybe). But with GDPR, it might become illegal in lots of other cases, like for simple websites that have contact forms where the user submits personal data. Or think of the bad practice of sending passwords in plain text via email, I see this all the time. And what if you download a backup copy of your website or your emails or your documents (all containing personal info about your clients for example), and you store the backup in a simple unencrypted USB key, or in an external drive that you keep in a drawer without a lock. All this is commonplace, and I personally see it everywhere from freelances to small companies, and while these bad practices might now be used to sue someone in case of trouble and show they are responsible, if nothing happens or if nobody sues you anyway, then who cares, it's ok. But with GDPR, all this will have to be documented explicitly, and there must be someone responsible for assessing all these situations and make sure everything is compliant all the time. So doesn't this mean that bad security practices are going to become illegal, no matter if those bad practices ever lead to data leaks or any problems? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Will GDPR (EU law) make bad practices in security illegal?"}

The law became necessary because the previous legislation in the Stored Communications Act (SCA) of 1986 was written before the advent of cloud computing, and it was unclear whether the US Government could demand that American companies turn over data that was stored on foreign servers. The law provides a framework for the United States to enter into bilateral agreements with other countries in relation to how data can be demanded/shared, but it also provides additional rules in absence of the bilateral agreements (none of which exist at this time). Under the CLOUD Act, can a US company be compelled by US courts to turn over data about a foreign (non-US) person if that data is stored on a foreign (non-US) server owned by the US company? For example, Amazon is a US company and they have an AWS Region in Canada. Since the data is stored in Canada, the CLOUD Act governs how US courts may demand access to that data. A Canadian company probably should not store personal (e.g. healthcare) information about their clients on a server where it would be vulnerable to foreign courts without the approval of Canadian courts. Therefore, this question has a significant effect on whether Canadian companies can use US-owned cloud services even if the data is held in Canada. My vague understanding is that the Cloud Act permits the US Government to demand cooperation from US companies with data overseas belonging to \"US persons\", with the possible exception that the US company has options to respond if this would violate the laws of the country where the data is stored. But what if the foreign data belongs to a non-US person? In that case, I am hoping that this would only be permitted according to the rules of one of the as yet unwritten reciprocal agreements with the foreign government. \nTITLE: ", "output": "How does the CLOUD Act apply for non-US persons' data stored on US-owned servers outside the USA?"}

Engineered mechanisms have existed in the world now for a few hundred years or so. The science here isn't really new. We're debating bringing out some software for mechanism design and synthesis. We are using really smart algorithms based on physics in the natural world. No magic, just brilliant use working with the existing laws of nature. One of our concerns is the potential for lawsuits by users of the software. We're not sure if we should share our algorithms openly or if we should seek to profit from them. For example: Joe Cheap Carnival company invents a new wild ride using our awesome cool mechanism synthesis software. They have Podunk Assembly Company manufacture it with cheapest materials possible with really poor quality control. The ride goes up at a local carnival and oops it fails, and someone gets seriously hurt. Here are my questions: If our software was used by Joe Cheap Carnival's design team to synthesize a mechanism used in the faulty carnival ride, and our software encompassed the use hidden and encoded algorithms, could we be held liable for the failure? If our software was absolutely open source (github), with all algorithms and logic flow in full public view, could we be sued? (Does this change the nature of \"responsibility\"? ) My questions relates to: Can the open source process be used as a legal protection against a potential lawsuit for a software company? Update (post DaleM response): I'm not sure I fully understand the \"duty of care\" description. We make software that tells engineers how machines move. Its a similar function to what you might read in an academic text, albeit in a much easier intuitive form to use. (Drag and drop is much easier than reading a chapter of text then doing mathematical problems, even though exactly the same concepts are being used.) The function of our code is to accurately represent the laws of physics. We don't tell somebody what to design, we tell them if you want this particular output, here are a variety of ways to achieve that output. Hmmm... Lets say someone wants to design a six bar mechanism to move an object in a 720 degree circle and deliver it as fast as possible we can help with that. Fancy Machine works uses that model to deliver bolts to an assembly line for rapid manufacturing. Max g forces observed on the bolt is 8 G's. Joe's Cheap Carnival decides to use that exact same mechanism to create an exciting ride for its customers. Its ten times the scale of the bolt delivery machine, but its the same basic mechanism design. Again, Max g forces observed on the customer sitting in the ride is 8 G's. Is our design unsafe? The bolts seem to get there just fine, people, no so much. We profess no responsibility (same as an academic text book author on mechanism design.) In fact that might be a better question. Have any academic folks been sued for academic publications providing \"how-to\" instructions?

Base on the \"Sino-British Joint Declaration\", the [Basic Law][1] is, and should be treated as a constitution for Hong Kong Special Administration Region. For the law itself, in Article 25 it states: Article 25 All Hong Kong residents shall be equal before the law. And in Article 37 it states: Article 37 The freedom of marriage of Hong Kong residents and their right to raise a family freely shall be protected by law. As for [the Ordinance of marriages in Hong Kong][2]: According to the Ordinance(Cap 181) s40, it states: (1) Every marriage under this Ordinance shall be a Christian marriage or the civil equivalent of a Christian marriage. (2) The expression \"Christian marriage or the civil equivalent of a Christian marriage\" implies a formal ceremony recognized by the law as involving the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. In the case \"Leung TC William Roy v Secretary for Justice\", we learnt that the case influenced the explanation of \"[Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance][3]\" s1 and s22, which includes the category of sexual orientation. Therefore my question would be: To the extend of freedom of marriage, and the right to raise a family freely, isn't the Marriage Ordinance is exact the opposite, which restricts the freedom of will that one would want same sex marriage? Would the freedom of marriage includes same sex couples? And will it become unconstitutional to the Ordinance itself, because of the allowance to one man and one woman?

If you met all of your targets for the year the bonus was 5% of your base salary. If you exceeded all of your targets for the year the bonus was 7% of your base salary. The scheme ran from the months June-June which meant that anyone who is employed from June to June the following year, providing that their performance was good, was entitled to a bonus. Despite the fact I was leaving at the end of July, I was under the presumption I'd receive my bonus and was even told verbally that I would get it, however, I never did.1 Since the performance meeting took place after the 25th (pay day) then I presumed that the bonus should come in the next pay day (since that's what I was told), which would also be my final salary payment from the company. I mostly worked all of July, I left a few days before the final salary payment was due, and to my surprise when I checked my payslip the bonus was not there. Since I had already had many issues with the company at this point, I did not feel like or rather, I did not have the energy to argue this and I'm not overly concerned about the money. I am just wondering what the legality of this is? Was I entitled to that bonus? Or is it ultimately down to director discretion? I'm really interested in the legalities of workplace bonuses since they do not seem to be guaranteed like salary. I appreciate that perhaps I should've got this in writing, however, I did not expect I would have to. The contract clearly states that an employee is entitled to that bonus if they meet their targets - as mentioned I did. In-fact, I even have a copy of my performance review document which shows in clear text that I met all of the targets thus as per the employment contract I should receive that 5% bonus. As a further aside: it's possible that in regards to the performance section of the contract when it comes to bonuses that the contract also stated that the bonus also relied upon the companies performance for that financial year, unfortunately I can't quite remember if it did mention that or not. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Did not receive yearly bonus, despite being employed at the company during the bonus period"}

The monthly fee has already been paid, as it is due by that day. The individual's family wishes to get a refund, pro-rated, for the remaining three weeks of January. The individual's family signed a contract at the beginning of the individual's stay there that is called \"Refund Policy\" and states that no refund will be given unless 30 days notice is given to the facility when that individual is \"leaving.\" Other words used in the same sentence included The facility also now has a separate form that speaks specifically to what would happen in the event of the death of an individual staying in the facility. This form is called \"No Refund Policy in Case of Death.\" It states there is no refund in the event of death, no matter what day of the month / no matter how much is paid for but will obviously not be used by that individual due to that individual's death. This form was never signed nor was the information it contains ever discussed with the individual or family. Question: Can the family get a pro-rated amount of money back for the time that the individual did not stay in the facility? Note: I understand that in contract situations, the contract governs. That said, is there a way to use the second form and its specific mention of \"death\" to show that the first form did not sufficiently explain its terms and/or was ambiguous at the time it was signed? If not, it sounds like \"one party relied on a statement of the other about a material fact that the second party knew or should have known was mistaken by the first party.\" And the existence of the second form would show that the second party knew or should have known that a form simply referencing \"leaving\" was insufficient for these purposes.

Her 1 year fixed term lease expires at the end of February, leaving her about 4 days to move out after her quarantine period. Prior to leaving the country, she had planned to renew her lease, until the landlord indicated the rent would be increasing $100 per month. The Landlord has made it clear that they have the right to show the premises at any time, and no intention of relinquishing that right, and therefore my daughter must find someplace else to reside during her 14 day quarantine. This would seem to meet the definition of a Frustrated Contract. \u201cA frustrated contract is a contract that, subsequent to its formation, and without fault of either party, is incapable of being performed due to an unforeseen event (or events), resulting in the obligations under the contract being radically different from those contemplated by the parties to the contract.\u201d Cut and pasted from Google. Realizing that my daughter would not be allowed to quarantine in her rented premises, we moved all her belongings into storage, cleaned the suite and turned in the keys a week ago. We have also noticed a very strange clause in her lease: 2.(c ) The Terms and Conditions and all Schedules of this Lease continue with the Occupancy of the Owner\u2019s property by the Tenant until the Tenant either signs a new lease with the Owner or vacates the premises, which ever occurs first. This seems very strange to me, but it appears that the Terms and Conditions of the lease have no effect after the Tenant vacates the premises.

Barbara Bagley was driving her family's Range Rover Dec. 27, 2011 on Interstate 80 near Battle Mountain, Nev., when it slid on sagebrush on Interstate 80, and flipped. Her husband, Bradley Vom Baur, was sent flying from the vehicle, suffered major injuries and died nearly two weeks later in a hospital, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. Bagley, 48, suffered a concussion, broken ribs, a shattered wrist and two punctured lungs. One of her dogs, a Shetland sheepdog named Dooley, ran from the scene and wandered the desert for 53 days before being found.

Vom Baur v. Barbara Bagley\" or simply \"Bagley v. Bagley.\" But more interesting is another comment: MrTrout Feb 19, 2015 If she is suing herself for negligence which resulted in the death of another, then the state should arrest her and charge her with manslaughter (ie- negligence resulting in the death of another). She is basically admitting she caused the death of her husband through negligence. From a legal perspective, seems pretty straight forward to me.

They reach preliminary agreement verbally, and so Aaron drafts a lease agreement, signs it, and sends it to Bob for his signature. (Suppose Aaron is managing the property remotely, from a far-away city, so they can't meet in person for the signing). Let's say this happens about 2 months before the start date of the lease. At this point, Bob has a lease agreement with Aaron's signature on it. It seems to me that if Bob is unscrupulous, he can delay adding his signature for up to 2 months. He can look for a better deal on a different apartment for that entire time. If he finds a better deal, he can simply tear up the contract with Aaron - after all, he never signed it! If he doesn't find a better deal, he can simply add his signature to the contract with Aaron to make it binding. On the other hand, it seems to me that Aaron is at a significant disadvantage - he cannot look for other tenants and sign anything with them, because at any point Bob can make the original lease valid, and force Aaron to lease to him. I realize that the lease itself could have some wording to solve this issue (e.g. \"only valid if signed by both parties by such-and-such date\"), but - for example - the standard lease agreement I've seen used in Washington State doesn't have any such clauses. So, my questions are: Is my understanding correct? Can Bob indeed delay signing, putting Aaron at a significant disadvantage? Or is there anything in law that would prevent such a trick on Bob's part? Does the answer change if this is lease renewal and not a new lease?

The title should be legally relevant, capture key aspects of the issue, and entice readers to learn more. \nQUESTION: During the COVID era, it was very common to see signs posted outside of businesses and probably public buildings, saying things like: Please do not come in if you are coughing, have a fever, or are short of breath. The problem I see is that, whether it's the exact three symptoms above, or whether it's another, similar list, these are extremely generic symptoms that are quite frequent for people with asthma or with other common, but non-contagious diseases. For example, an adult asthmatic may be fine 95% of the time, but if they were just visiting a friend's house where several cats and dogs live, they may have a brief, minor issue with \"shortness of breath\" or \"wheezing\". And it gets worse if they have OCD and are analytical. An individual like that might, for example, notice that their breathing is 99%, not 100%. (Of course, most people with OCD know and are perfectly able to just ignore the sign at that point, but it can make one flinch for half a second and be slightly unwelcoming.) So this not only affects people with common physical problems, but common psychological ones as well. The bad thing is that these signs were practically everywhere during the pandemic - grocery stores certainly included - and things like the two conditions mentioned above are only example of a much larger list which affects a large swathe of the general population. But these conditions are not contagious, and they are often genetic. On the other hand though, they are also chronic. Now, I want to highlight this: Common sense is common sense, and normally these signs would be ignored. However, if we use the example above about the cats and dogs, the asthmatic might cough a couple of times, which would be noticeable; but in this case, it does not suggest COVID, and the problem is something that is chronic. And while that's a temporary matter, they may be very slightly \"short of the breath\" all the time. Despite being practically everywhere, were/are these signs and rules illegally discriminating against a large swath of the population with common, chronic, and non-contagious conditions? To the extent a specific country is required, let's use the US and regulations like the ADA, though I'd be interested to hear about other countries as well. UPDATE: The currently accepted answer (as of 2021-7-23, at which point it was the only answer) was a little hard for me to follow at first, because I believe there was some context I didn't see initially. Without that context, the rationale and flow behind the answer didn't seem to follow logically. In particular, when it was mentioned that people are expected to know the law, usually I think of that as mainly applying to the offender, as opposed to the victim. An offender can always still say or do something illegally though, and a victim's knowledge or ignorance of the law doesn't grant the offender a free pass to impede their rights. However with the proper context, the answer does seem to follow. I could be misinterpreting something, but per a few comments back and forth, I think this is a rough paraphrase/summary, context included: Basically the dividing line is a matter of how clearly the alleged offender is addressing the alleged victim. In the case of a typical COVID sign, there's typically supposed to be context that the sign doesn't apply to people who just have things like asthma, unless, for example, a store employee actually addresses the individuals directly. Therefore it is not clearly and unambiguously barring them for symptoms clearly attributable to asthma (or whatever the condition is). In this way, it is similar to how a \"DO NOT ENTER\" sign at the gate of a private property does not apply to friends and family who have previously been welcomed by the owner. Also, the precise manner in which the sign is worded can weigh against this, but it doesn't single-handedly decide the case. However a \"Please do not enter if you are <race/color/ethnicity X>\" sign, for example, is illegal, because even in the proper context, it is still quite clear it applies to the people literally mentioned. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Did \"stay at home\" signs during COVID unlawfully discriminate against people with conditions like asthma?"}

I consider myself very knowledgeable about this subject, but I am not an expert nor do I have any personal experience. My case is pretty straightforward and I expect that the application will be successful, but I want to hire a professional to avoid the stress of doing everything myself, as well as ensure that I don't cause any unnecessary issues for myself through an error on my part. I have never had significant business with an attorney before. There are many attorneys in my area, and all of them seem to want a consultation to discuss any details (including price). However, I'm finding this process a bit confusing and difficult. Even though my application is mostly finished, they don't want to look at it in detail until I actually hire them (usually the consultation is free or much cheaper than their services). They often assure that my case will be simple, but that doesn't help me choose which one to actually hire. After some thinking, I've come up with my own list of what an attorney can compete on. Ranked from most important to least, it is: Accuracy: Make sure the application doesn't get unnecessarily denied or delayed due to how it's filled Speed: Prepare and submit everything quickly. Friendliness and not being distracted by other cases while dealing with mine. Experience: Ideally with other people from my country, but also family green cards in general. Price and value (most want to charge a flat fee for this). Generally, in a consultation a lawyer reviews the client's case and tells them what can be done about it. However, I already have a good idea of this from personal research as well as previous consultation. My goal in the consultation is really to figure out how competitive the lawyer is in the five areas I've listed above. So, what should I ask during the consultation to help me determine which lawyer is most suitable for me? I would have liked to simply pull out the above list, and say \"I am shopping around and I will hire the person who best meets these criteria, give me your pitch on how well you can meet them\", but that would probably be a rude thing to do. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Shopping for US immigration lawyers: What to ask in consultation?"}

We had used their garbage bin, in Feb 2020, and requested them to pick it up as it was full on Feb 17th. They could not pick up as the load needed to be repacked, so they had left it.

The custodian, of course, has possession of the stolen item and refuses to return it. Can he be charged with a crime \u2013 e.g., for possession of stolen property?

Even without the call can the supervisor incur any criminal liability due to his failure to prevent or address the crime? Can the police department as an entity be charged with any crime, since (as I assume the previous items suggest) the fact that the crime was carried out and not corrected (e.g., by immediate return of the property) implicates a number of its officers for criminally acting, failing to act, and \u2013 presumably \u2013 failing to properly train and supervise the original actor?

Most of you probably haven't heard of this, but there are people like me who reverse engineer games, and make software that exploit the games code and memory in order to gain an advantage. Basically, we have to reverse games to know where the game stores different information, like your players health, position, and weapon. Reverse engineering involves taking an executable you get when you buy the game, and seeing where the code stores information. Based on this information, you can make a program to access the information you found while reversing, and modify it to give you an advantage. I've only read some stuff on the DMCA, but I am unsure if this qualifies for it. Most games have an \"anti-cheat\" which try to detect people who use cheats and ban them from the game. As a cheat developer, you have to bypass these counter measures, and sometimes these counter measures are present in the executable in the form of packing / obfuscation which just makes it harder to analyze.

While I learned a lot of interesting tidbits of information perusing the U.S.C., I was amazed at how poorly it was structured. I know politics is sticky business, and not everything is going to be clean, but what I saw struck me as exceptionally bad. In software design, there's a widely used phrase to describe certain particularly jumbled programs: spaghetti code. This term can be applied to programs which have poor data structure designs, are poorly organized, or simply just don't make logical sense in terms of the way they are laid out. The name comes from how these attributes can be applied to a bowl of spaghetti; it's jumbled and tangled together, and you would be required to really dig deep to find, say, the two ends of a single strand. As someone who is very active in open-source programming, a development style that fundamentally breeds spaghetti code, my first reaction upon seeing the U.S.C. in its entirety was, \"Oh my god, this is spaghetti code.\" The organization is so horribly jumbled. For example, in regards to the Titles, why would topics that sound so incredibly broad, such as Title 6 - Domestic Security, and Title 12 - Banks and Banking, be in the same structural level as Title 23 - Highways, or Title 24 - Hospitals and Asylums? Why do we have Title 14 - Coast Guard and Title 32 - National Guard when there is Title 10 - Armed Forces? The Coast Guard and the National Guard are clearly both a subset of the Armed Forces. Why is a \"machine gun\" defined under Title 26 - Internal Revenue Code, when every single other type of firearm seems to be defined under Title 18 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure?

That leads me to my questions (finally): 1. Are there any underlying reasons behind the nonsensical structure of U.S.C. titles?

These people take structure very seriously, and they are very unhappy with the structure of the U.S.C.

The question has arisen whether mutuality needs to have been present from the outset\u2014from the time of entering into the contract\u2014or only by the time of enforcing it. The nineteenth-century formulation (in Fry on Specific Performance) expressed the doctrine as requiring that the remedy of specific performance should have been potentially available to either party at the time the contract is made. [Example] Mutuality from the outset D agrees to grant a lease of a house to C in return for C\u2019s promise personally to renovate the house. D\u2019s promise could not be specifically enforced against D [1.] since [2.] D would not be able to get specific performance of C\u2019s obligation to renovate (it being a personal obligation). Furthermore, following Fry, the objection of lack of mutuality would still persist even if C had already done the renovation because the mutuality had to exist at the time of formation of the contract. This is a typo right? This ought be C. I don't understand the emboldened phrase. Unquestionably this is a contract? D's promise (grant of a lease) is consideration for C's promise to renovate, and C's promise is consideration for D's promise. This example is readying the reader for this case in the bottom para. ibid. This view was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Price v Strange [[1977] 3 W.L.R. 943]. The trial judge held that specific performance of an agreement to grant an underlease of a flat could not be ordered against the defendant because specific performance could not have been ordered against the claimant who had contracted to repair and decorate the flat (following Fry\u2019s approach). The Court of Appeal reversed this decision and granted specific performance of the underlease since the claimant had done the repairs and decoration until he had been prevented from doing so by the defendant, and he had promised to pay to the defendant the cost of completing the repairs he had not done. There was therefore no danger of the defendant being left high and dry after complying with the court\u2019s order of specific performance. \nTITLE: ", "output": "If D leases a house to C for C's promise to renovate it personally, why can't D get specific performance of C's obligation?"}

In the middle, I see different levels of decriminalization. Below, I will write down the different points I imagine exist on the spectrum, starting at completely illegal, and making my way towards strictly legal. Completely illegal crime. Law enforcement's focus and resources directed away from that kind of crime. The above, in addition to LEOs attaining the discretion to not arrest the criminal, or press charges. LEOs advised/implored not to arrest or press charges against people committing the crime. The act isn't punishable, but the agent is obligated/prohibited to do certain things after being caught. The act isn't punishable, but the agent can be obligated/prohibited to do certain things after being caught. The act isn't punishable, and no actions can be obligated of, or prohibited from, the agent after being caught. The action is strictly legal. Points 5. and 6. can be further subdivided, where the subtypes are different in whether the violation of the obligations and prohibitions are punishable, and/or if the agent can be physically forced to comply with the obligations/prohibitions. I am not sure where those subtypes would lie in relation to each other on a spectrum of legality however. I also want to point out that in cases/jurisdiction where the choice to enforce a law or not is already up to the LEO's discretion, points 2. and 3. are equivalent. However, if a jurisdiction originally does not allow LEO's to use their discretion in relation to arresting/charging a criminal, but then changes policies to allow such, it seems to me a step towards \"greater legality\". Also, this is a spectrum differentiated by changes in policy and law, not changes in culture. A kind of cultural decriminalization could exist at any of these points, where the police and/or people do not care about the crime at all. Since this kind of decriminalization doesn't necessarily depend on (though of course is influenced by) any of the points on the spectrum, it exists outside of the spectrum. So, my questions are the following: Is my conceptualization correct? Is this a concept established and accepted in jurisprudence, and if so, where and by whom? Are the more points to add? \nTITLE: ", "output": "The spectrum of legality"}

Elliott distinguishes between judicial review (\"JR\") to enforce duties on agencies, and judicial review to enforce rights. He says this is an important but subtle distinction. It is too subtle for me to fathom. Can someone please ELI15 (Explain Like I'm Fifteen)? 3.3.2 Possible approaches to standing We think differently about the public law that is enforced via judicial review than we do about the private law that is enforced in claims brought in contract, tort, and so on. When claimants seek judicial review, they are not seeking to vindicate rights that have allegedly been infringed by, for example, a procedurally unfair government decision. Rather, they are seeking to enforce the duties\u2014for example, the duty to act fairly\u2014under which public law places government bodies. This is a subtle, yet important, distinction. It reflects the fact that whereas the prevailing view is that a breach of contract is an essentially private matter, a breach of public law is something in which the public generally has a legitimate interest. On this view, even if a specific individual suffers particular harm as a result of an unlawful decision by a public body, the public as a whole has an interest in ensuring that government authorities respect the principles of good administration that the courts have developed. \nTITLE: ", "output": "How is judicial review about seeking to enforce government bodies' duties, but not rights allegedly infringed?"}

A friend of a friend was recently pulled over while driving a rental car that was rented in my friend's name. The driver (aka - friend of a friend) was not listed on the rental car contract as a person allowed to drive the rental vehicle. He was stopped by police and the vehicle was searched inside and out, with the officers telling the driver he was not even allowed to legally drive the vehicle, and since he was in a car rented under someone else\u2019s name, and without him listed as a driver on the contract, they didn't need his permission, didn't need probable cause and didn't even need a search warrant to tear the car apart under the suspicion he was transporting a controlled substance. It came out in the court case that followed, that the driver basically \"appeared suspicious\" to the officer, and this was the entire reason behind the search of the vehicle with no probable cause or search warrant and no permission to search the rental. Should the driver have the same rights in a rental car that he's not a listed driver on the rental contract, as he would if he was in his own vehicle; which should protect him against illegal search and seizures by police with no probable cause, as police stated in their own words at his trial?

Then it was announced that the DOJ Chief of Staff, Matthew Whitaker would be the Acting AG and according to the Hill, NyPost, and others: \"The Acting Attorney General is in charge of all matters under the purview of the Department of Justice,\" DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement to The Hill. And yet, on the basis of this legal analysis in Slate over a year ago, there are only three things that the President can do with respect to this without going through the Senate: He could ... follow the terms of the DOJ succession statute and his own executive order on DOJ succession, under both of which the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, would automatically become the acting attorney general ... The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998: A more complicated scenario would be to rely on the provision codified at 5 U.S. Code Section 3345(a)(2), which states: \u201cnotwithstanding [the default rule that the deputy becomes the acting], the President (and only the President) may direct a person who serves in an office for which appointment is required to be made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to perform the functions and duties of the vacant office temporarily in an acting capacity...

Original jurisdiction of the US Supreme Court cannot be limited (nor expanded) by the US Congress, but the appellate jurisdiction can. My understanding is as follows: the US Supreme Court's original jurisdiction is not necessarily exclusive, and thus other courts can also have original jurisdiction over these cases, which is known as concurrent jurisdiction. The plaintiff can thus choose the court in which he files the lawsuit. If the plaintiff chose to start the case not in the US Supreme Court, but rather in another court having original jurisdiction, then the US Supreme Court could have only appellate jurisdiction over such case. Is it correct? If so, could the US Congress strip the US Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction over cases over which the US Supreme Court has original jurisdiction? Edit: In an already deleted answer, It was argued that SCOTUS' original and appellate jurisdiction is mutually-exclusive, according to Marbury v. Madison. However, it seems that SCOTUS has rejected this argument in Cohens v.

But, I read that cancellation-of-debt (\"COD\") is taxable income. How Oliver got around this (\"...no tax consequences whatsoever...\") seems odd... Oliver set up a dummy corporation (\"CARP\") and then as CEO of CARP, he negotiated the debt purchase (presumably from some other collection agency). But, rather than forgive the debt directly, CARP turned around and donated the debt to RIP, a charitable organization. Am I to understand that this second transfer was necessary in order to explicitly avoid the tax consequence of COD? I do understand that COD is taxable income, but \"gifts\" are not. CARP is a simple $50 setup-fee LLC (and presumably not a charitable organization), whereas RIP was/is an established 501(c)(3) charity. I'm assuming that Once CARP purchased the debt, it then had rights of ownership with respect to debt collection, i.e. it could (1) continue pursuing collections from the debtors, (2) do nothing with the debt, (3) forgive the debts individually or en masse, or (4) donate it to a charity (which is what it did). After CARP gave (donated) the debt to RIP, then RIP was free to forgive the debts (which is its explicitly-stated mission). Had CARP pursued option (3) above, then does that mean all that forgiven debt was/is taxable income as COD? ADDENDUM: I just now realized that, in a theoretical situation where CARP chose option (1) -- attempt to collect on the debt. Pretending that CARP successfully collected e.g. $1 million, is this simply money that CARP can keep? (Subject to corporate income tax, of course.) I'm also assuming that \"purchasing\" debt gives the purchaser rights of ownership such that any collected money from a debtor cannot be further claimed by previous creditors.

It seems that this person would be an inadmissible alien since they fail to meet the documentary requirements under INA 212(a)(7). There are some ways out of this situation: the inspecting officer could waive the documentary requirement (INA 211(b)), grant deferred inspection (8 CFR 235.2), or permit the alien to withdraw their application for admission (INA 235(a)(4)). However, all of those require an exercise of discretion. Therefore, it appears that if DHS is really determined to deport the arriving alien in this situation, they can refuse to grant a waiver, refuse to grant deferred inspection, refuse to grant withdrawal, and place the alien in removal proceedings. In removal proceedings, the immigration judge could similarly deny all forms of relief and issue an order of removal. The alien would then lose their LPR status and be banned from the US for 5 years. Legally speaking, are there a way for such an arriving alien (a returning LPR, who has previously complied with all immigration laws, has not abandoned their residence, and has merely lost their green card on the way to the port of entry) to avoid deportation that does not require a favourable exercise of discretion? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Can lawful permanent residents be deported from the US for arriving at a port of entry without a green card?"}

The market value of it is really $500k, but he thinks he can get $1M. A bank gives him a loan for $900k with a lien against the property. He lists it for sale at $1M, then $915k, but it fails to sell due to a bad downturn. Then he rents it out, then he gets foreclosed on. He deeds it to the bank in lieu of foreclosure. Can anything he did be considered a step \"preliminary to the execution ... of a unit sales agreement?\" I would argue that since no one executed a unit sales agreement, then nothing this developer did could be proven to be actually preliminary to a unit sales agreement. When the developer rented it out, this was a step preliminary to foreclosure; he knew he was doomed and just tried to milk the property for whatever he could before he had to hand it over to the bank. However, the defense will argue that his advertising the units for sale was, in fact, a \"preliminary\" step to the execution of a sales agreement, purely because a sale was his reasonable ultimate goal and such steps normally are preliminary to sales. Who is right? Do particular facts and reality matter at all for what counts as \"preliminary\"? If not, why is this even part of the law? If facts don't matter then why do we have courts?

The suit was bought over the stealthy collection of the web browsing histories of people who owned iPhones.

My question is after President Trump leaves office, can a new president overrule the pardon? My understanding is if the pardon is issued during a the trial the trial would be halted. If the pardon was later overruled the individual would need to be tried again, but double jeopardy would probably get in the way. This might also extend to if the pardon is issued after the charges were filed but prior to the trial. Double jeopardy may also prevent overruling a pardon after a conviction since it would require a new conviction to punish the individual.

All three companies have now been sold to other companies, some of them several times, and some copyrights they held were sold independently of the companies themselves. There doesn't seem to be a record of this particular game's copyright in any of these deals (the game did not sell particularly well). Speaking with members of the original development team, it is believed the publisher had the original copyrights, but none of them are sure. The copyright does not appear on http://cocatalog.loc.gov/ using any conceivable search. The company most likely to have picked up copyrights from the original publisher is not responding to communication attempts. In the US, is it possible to find out who owns a copyright? If so, how is this done? UPDATE The game was first published in Europe, then the PAL region, finally being published in the US.

Update based on comments and answers: This question primarily concerns laws that target holders of specific citizenships \u2014 as opposed to foreigners in general.

Per Article 13 of the ePrivacy Directive - i.e. Directive 2002/58/EC: The use of automated calling systems without human intervention (automatic calling machines), facsimile machines (fax) or electronic mail for the purposes of direct marketing may only be allowed in respect of subscribers who have given their prior consent. And, per Article 2(h), 'electronic mail' would include social media messages such as LinkedIn messages: \"electronic mail\" means any text, voice, sound or image message sent over a public communications network which can be stored in the network or in the recipient's terminal equipment until it is collected by the recipient 'Direct marketing' is not defined in the ePrivacy Directive, but the UK Information Commissioner's Office gives the following guidance (my emphasis): Direct marketing is defined in section 122(5) of the Data Protection Act 2018 as: \u201cthe communication (by whatever means) of advertising or marketing material which is directed to particular individuals\u201d. This covers all advertising or promotional material, including that promoting the aims or ideals of not-for-profit organisations \u2013 for example, it covers a charity or political party campaigning for support or funds. The marketing must be directed to particular individuals. In practice, all relevant electronic messages (eg calls, faxes, texts and emails) are directed to someone, so they fall within this definition. Genuine market research does not count as direct marketing. However, if a survey includes any promotional material or collects details to use in future marketing campaigns, the survey is for direct marketing purposes and the rules apply. From this, it seems that: (a) Prior consent would be required to send messages to specific individuals to promote the nonprofit's offering, including via LinkedIn. (b) A simple message asking if a person would be interested in learning more, or otherwise trying to obtain their consent, would itself be considered direct marketing, so itself require prior consent... If this is correct, how could the nonprofit legally contact the relevant stakeholders? I am confused about what should be done in this case. It seems very strange that a person at a company who might be interested in using the nonprofit's services cannot even be sent a one-line opt-in request to receive more details on LinkedIn. Any thoughts gratefully appreciated. Some solutions I have considered: Take advantage of the difference between 'corporate subscribers' and 'individual subscribers' in the UK's implementation of the ePrivacy Directive (PECR), which allows direct marketing to employees' corporate email addresses. Only applies to the UK and probably does not apply to LinkedIn. Phone the individual concerned to obtain consent prior to sending a message. Requires knowing the phone number and is time-consuming. Contact the company's official email address (e.g. info@company.com) instead. Impractical as reply rate is very low from such addresses. \nTITLE: ", "output": "How could a nonprofit obtain consent to message relevant individuals at a company on LinkedIn under the ePrivacy Directive?"}

Donald J. Trump, Waltine Nauta, and Carlos De Oliveira, Waltine Nauta's defense refers to Donald Trump as the \"lead defendant\". I'm wondering whether this is a precisely defined legal term. The term is apparently in common use, including in official government communication (e.g. here, here, here), but I can't find a definition for it anywhere. The term seems to appear neither in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure nor in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Wikipedia article on Obergefell v. Hodges says \"Wymyslo was substituted as the lead defendant, and the case was restyled Obergefell v. Wymyslo\", but none of the documents in the references for that statement contain the term \"lead defendant\". The statement seems to indicate that the lead defendant is the first one in the list of defendants, whose name is used for the case style. If so, does this have any legal relevance beyond the style? In the original indictment and the superseding indictment, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira are referred to as \"Trump's co-conspirators\", whereas Trump himself is never referred to as a \"co-conspirator\". That might suggest that Trump is alleged to be something like the \"lead conspirator\", but the conspiracy statute makes no distinctions among the conspirators. So my impression is that \"lead defendant\" is just an informal term for the defendant whose name appears first in the list of defendants, and that this carries no legal implications.

However, what happens if two independent websites host seemingly random data, which combined (by XOR-ing) form a stream of copyrighted material? The idea is rather simple, someone has digital copyrighted material, the digital form might be 011001 (CR). He then creates a random string of binary digits, for example 010111 (XOR1) and XORs the copyrighted material with the original, resulting in 001110 (XOR2). Both XOR1 and XOR2 seem random and unrelated to CR, but when XOR-ed, they form CR. Now this person anonymously uploads XOR1 and XOR2 to independent hosts, and publishes links to both on a third independent forum. I would assume the anonymous person violates the copyright, but do any of the three hosts do so as well? Can the copyright holder force the removal of XOR1 or XOR2, since for neither XOR1 nor XOR2 it is provable that it is derived from CR and independently both look random. Moreover, is the post on the forum illegal, as it describes how to get the copyrighted material, but doesn't host it itself? I am curious about this w.r.t. either Dutch or US law. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Hosting One time pad of copyrighted material"}

Intellectual property, ideas and inventions Any Ideas or Inventions you have or make or any Materials that you create or develop in the course of your employment with us and/or using our equipment or materials will (subject to the provisions of the Patents Act 1977 and Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988) automatically, on creation of the same, be the absolute property of the Company. By signing this contract you\u2019re agreeing to take all actions required by the Company to protect the Invention or Idea or Materials and to pass ownership to the Company. You also agree to waive all of your moral rights under the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988.

Q2: If Griffin would be justified in feeling threatened by my hypothetical ad (as described in Q1), would her (now infamous) picture with a fake severed head of POTUS not be justified in being viewed and treated as the same type of threat? Is there an extra exception because she is known for her provocative style of performance which uses politics for shock value? Is this (perhaps) uncharted waters from the legal standpoint? Perhaps because the constitutionality of the above statute has never been tested? Similarly, why would her depiction not be investigated as incitement of violence? What's the standard there? If any acts of violence are committed by 3rd parties as a result of seeing that picture, will she then bare any culpability?

I fully plan on paying the pro-rated amount for this month ($monthly_rent * (8 days / 30 days) = $pro-rated amount). My roommate hasn't found anyone to replace me yet and is saying I'm on the hook for each day of November that the room I moved out of is vacant. When I explained that this goes against the terms of the sublease, he claimed that \"it's an issue of equitability that judges freely allow.\" He claims he is entitled to pro-rated rent for each day of vacancy all the way to the end of November since I didn't tell him I was looking for a new place and that he needed more time to get the place cleaned up to show to prospective tenants. It is worth noting that I chipped in $60 to help him pay for a cleaning service. Is he right? Is there ever a case where I'm liable for pro-rated rent beyond the 30 day notice period?

However, over recent months, Medium has become increasingly focused on their own partnerships and internal publications, to the point where it's hard to argue that there is not an ethical conflict of interest. My question is whether there's a legal conflict of interest. General Idea To put it into general terms, consider three parties, A, B, and C. Party A offers party B and C the opportunity to profit from an operation, where parties B and C are in competition with one another for a finite amount of revenue in a given month (the total available from subscription fees in this case). Further suppose that the operation relies on party C for success (it seems easy to argue that Medium would have trouble surviving if only their own content was on the platform), and that party A provides biased support to party B. Finally, B and C are paid by A, from the revenue generated by the operation, rather than B and C obtaining the revenue directly from the operation's customers. In such a scenario, there seems to be both an ethical issue and potentially legal issue. However, I am not familiar with any specific civil statutes that may come into play. Does it appear that the above scenario might violate any specific statute? The one potential reason why Medium might be saved from a valid lawsuit is that an author does not have to pay for the service. However, they are providing support, in their aggregate, through the massive volume of writing that they provide to the platform, without very much chance of being able to actually generate revenue. Precedent from cases involving pyramid schemes may apply here. Michael Seifert raised an interesting question: \"How would this be different from Publishing House A promoting a more profitable Author B instead of a less profitable Author C?\" The difference is that the publishing house does not rely on C's work for sales. To continue this analogy, consider a situation where the publishing house put in a request for chapters for an anthology, where the majority of the chapters came from C, and a few came from B. Further suppose that the publishing house paid its authors based on how many sales the respective authors generated, but almost exclusively promoted author B's website that sold the anthology. Even though readers likely would not purchase the anthology, without the chapters provided by C, because of A's disproportionate support of B, C would receive very little of the revenue stream. BlueDogRanch made a point that Medium's terms of services \"says nothing about being fair, or ethical.\" Agreed. Its terms of services say nothing, and therefore it does not say that they reserve the right to unfair, unequal, or unethical, biases. If the terms of service stated that Medium reserves the right to unequal promotion of work regardless of whether it reduces the potential revenue by other authors, then Medium would have a greater chance of winning in court, and greater justification for their actions. However, without such statements, it becomes less certain that one should assume that a content facilitator that provides revenue streams as part of a partner program would engage in actions that disproportionately shift revenue streams towards their own content. A final point. It seems that in California, an individual must pass the \"ABC\" test, at least when it comes to wage orders. Specifically, Medium's authors do not pass B: the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business. It seems that, contrary to the suggestion that Medium's authors are subcontractors, they are, at least as far as California law is concerned, employees. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Is Medium at risk of legal action?"}

Those terms can cover quite a bit of ground as to what SE might be able to do with the content. \"Distribution\" could reasonably be considered to include a wide variety of things which might be necessary to distribute the content in various forms. \"Commercial exploitation\" reasonably includes advertising, which is the purpose behind posting on Twitter. Granting a license to what is, effectively, the advertising company, would be a fairly normal part of \"Commercial exploitation\".

So first of all it is true that Google Analytics can use anonymized IPs, however GA also drops a tracking cookie used to distinguish users, with an expiration time of 2 years.

Recital 47 says this: The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest So it seems possible, however due to the use of \"may\" all this says is that \"analytics\" can be regarded as a legitimate interest, however the publisher still needs to establish the legitimate interest.

Meanwhile, I have read a number of civil court decisions where judges quite convincingly articulated their suspicions of a party to the case having been dishonest about the facts, and laid out their reasons for being suspicious of the party\u2019s honesty and credibility. Yet, the only consequence of this had appeared to be that the party was disbelieved on that point of fact which was in dispute and consequently (in these cases) lost the case(s). At no point were the disbelieved parties warned that they may face other consequences for the fact that they were found to have lied to and misled the court, much less proceeded against for having apparently done so. Likewise, in a criminal context, it seems fairly often that a defendant would testify insistently and adamantly to a false narrative of their innocence perhaps on the basis of a concocted false alibi, but is nonetheless found guilty. In these cases it seems that the consequence is basically that they are convicted, with perhaps less sympathy or concession than they may otherwise have gotten for pleading guilty honestly at sentencing, but there is no further separate proceedings for lying in open court. How often does it actually happen that a party is actually proceeded against for perjury / misleading a judicial body / contempt of court, or faces any other consequences for doing so other than losing their dispute/point/case? And whatever the answer, why is this? Is there any precise statistical data available as to the frequency of such occurrences? Honestly it seems like courts would hardly have the manpower and resources to proactively take it upon themselves to go after and proceed against everyone who has ever made a dubious statement to them. Are there any notable cases that come to mind which one may consider for a better understanding of the issue?

One time I decided to run a packet sniffer on my phone's network traffic just out of curiosity, and saw that every time I open that game, it makes an unencrypted HTTP request to the developer's server, and the server sends back the UNIX time. I set up a fake server on my LAN that increments by one hour every time it is requested, regardless of how much time actually passes, and used a custom DNS server to make the app's requests go to my spoofed server.

The main purpose of this was to save money. All four of our names are on the lease. We split everything equally four ways and in theory it would make things a lot cheaper. 4 months into the lease I broke up with my girlfriend. Without going into too many breakup details, I was the victim of domestic violence shortly after the breakup (about 2 weeks ago) in which my ex-girlfriend assaulted me. She was taken to jail that night and released sometime the next day on certain terms. One probably being that she couldn't return to the residence. Now based on my understanding she doesn't technically have any legal binding to pay her part regardless of her name being on the lease. It was a personal agreement between all of us to split everything equally, so the landlord doesn't care who pays what, as long as he/she gets the full amount each month, right? So it comes down to us 3 to come up with the full rent payment now. The other two are refusing to pick up her part, and I don't really have the money to cover her part alone. No luck on finding an additional roommate yet, but that's not within the scope of this question. So I read online that I may be able to terminate a lease being the victim of domestic assault - Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 \u00a7\u00e2 I have no idea how to look up this law, and even if did I probably would not know how to interpret it.

To get a 5% deductible, I basically have to buy 1/10 of a house over my lifetime... but the chance of losing my home to an earthquake over that timeframe is only 1/500. But then I noticed that for half the cost, I could buy a policy with a 20% deductible on the full value, and then a second policy with a 20% deductible on 20% of the value. To effectively get a 4% deductible.... at almost half the cost. Because of the lower deductible, the premium on the first policy drops by half. The second policy is 1/5 of that. The payout with these two new policies is as good as one policy with a 4% deductible. For example, if the home is destroyed, then I collect 80% of the home value from policy 1, and another 16% of the home value from policy 2. So, in total, I get 96% of the value, just as in a 4% deductible plan. Neither policy is paying out any more or less than it would have if I had just one of the two new policies. So I am not causing any harm to either insurer by having the other one. Right? Generally speaking, double-insuring things is legal. For example, I can insure stocks or mortgages that I don't own, and I can have 15 life insurance policies.

I'm a big fan of being legally allowed to have \"verbal\" contracts for most things (legally enforceable provided sufficient evidence exists on the details of the contract, e.g., through \"verbal\" communication over email), but this condition makes it appear like I must actually hire a lawyer to draft some officially-looking contract, with signature fields and all. (I guess the question here may also be on whether or not communication over email falls under \"verbal\" or \"written\" \"contract\" in this context?) This condition sounds very fishy to me, as you're legally allowed to do most business transactions without a \"written contract\" otherwise. Would this condition be enforceable? Would it be void due to being too ambiguous on what \"written contract\" means? What rights I may have through other laws that this condition might violate? (Right of free association?

My next-door neighbors smoke cigarettes and marijuana outside their house multiple times a day, with one reliable smoke session between 10 and 10:30 PM. Due to the terrain and prevailing air flows, their smoke flows directly around and past my house on all sides (it's not clear to me if it depends on whether they do their smoking in the front yard, back yard, or what, but suffice it to say that smoke regularly comes on all sides). As we don't have air conditioning, in the summer we cool our house at night by opening windows and running fans to circulate air. Needless to say, this means that when the neighbors light up, their smoke heads straight into our house, an extremely objectionable situation for us. It is not a faint whiff. Do we have any legal options to try to put a stop to this? Are there any laws along the lines of \"quiet enjoyment of my own home\" that could help? Even though marijuana is not illegal in Washington state at the state level, does the fact that it is still illegal at the federal level make a difference? I know for a fact that the neighbor rents. If I were able to get in touch with their landlord, could there be any action that the landlord could be forced to take to deal with the tenants? The neighbors are not the type to care about the experience of others or to care much about observing inconvenient laws. One of their close relatives (who lives in the next house farther away) owns a marijuana shop. Their children have bullied mine, and they were unapologetic and angry when approached about it rather than open and receptive. If we have no legal options here, then something is wrong. It's ridiculous that we would have recourse about objectionably loud noises, but not about sending smoke into our very bedrooms when we're trying to cool off.

I experienced the usual \"mail overlap\" period of a few weeks, during which I was happy to pass letters & small packages either back to our carrier. These trickled away and I felt like things had settled. Then, the first \"big box\" came. It seems the previous tenant works in sales/marketing, and about once a month I've gotten large packages from various marketing firms. Most of these are shipped via non-USPS carriers (UPS & FedEx are most prevalent here, though I've occasionally seen DHL as well). Initially, I tried taking these to our property managers, but they informed me that they had no forwarding info for the previous tenants and that I should follow up with the delivery folks instead. Our landlord was similarly stumped regarding getting in touch with the former tenants. I spoke to a couple drivers and was told that they could take them, but that they would likely be redelivered. I tried this and had the packages redelivered multiple times by different drivers before giving up. I called both UPS & FedEx and was told that I could hang onto the packages for the tenant or destroy them (I got this from both different companies twice - I didn't believe it the first time, either). FedEx offered me the option of adding a special rule that packages addressed to the previous tenant would not be delivered here, but there's a further complicating factor - we share almost the same name. Whereas I'm \"Kyle Robins\" (pseudonym), the former tenant was \"Kyle Robinson\" (also pseudonym - but really, the similarity is kind of creepy). So when I suggested taking advantage of the \"don't deliver to this person\" feature, the rep was kind enough to warn me that there may be some missed mail due to name confusion. I do a significant portion of my business online and a few missed packages could translate to \"can't pay my rent this month\", so that's a pretty big concern for me. Ultimately, the same rep informed me that I could hold or destroy the packages. I tried calling some of the companies listed on the package return addresses, but most of them are just printshops and couldn't give me any info about specific ordering companies I could call to try and rectify the situation. A few suggested I open the packages to get more info, but honestly opening a package not meant for me scares me more than just throwing the whole box out uninvestigated. After over a year of having these poster-sized packages accumulating in a corner, I tossed the lot of them into the bin. Since then I've received others and done the same, but it worries me more every time I do so. I'm approaching the 2-year mark with no contact from the former tenant, and I'm curious: is there a proper way to handle this situation? Does the US Code mentioned here apply to non-USPS vendors as well? I feel like I've done everything I could be reasonably expected to so short of buying a shed to store \"other-Kyle\"'s boxes for him, but I don't want something important to slip by for both of our sakes! As a clarifying point: These are all large, mostly unmarked boxes - nothing hand addressed or customized. There were some similar packages left in the attic when we moved in full of pamphlets/foldouts/posters, leading me to believe these are the same sorts of things. Anything obviously personal has come & gone via USPS - I suppose I would just hold an obviously personal package or Amazon delivery from another carrier indefinitely. \nTITLE: ", "output": "What is the proper way of handling non-USPS packages for long-gone tenants?"}

There are many articles about this incident, as well. Barring anything being the owner's fault, the lawyer in the video said that the dealer would put in a new engine and that would be that. He did mention about collectabity of the car could be damaged. However, he said he would not get into that. However, I am curious. People buy new cars as investments and not for driving. Having matching VINs on the car and engine demands higher prices upon resale.

However, this does theoretically hurt the long term value of the car. Is there any legal recovery for this loss?

A hypothetical Company A knows that their implementation does not conform to \"Best Practices\" - that their users dismiss pop-ups and walls-of-text as fast as they possibly can. Their users are typically not even aware that they are being presented Terms of Service and often can't recall any single term of that service. Company A knows of better Design Pattern Standards, to present these terms clearly and concisely, but decides not to present the Terms of Service that way. Subsequently, Company A relies on those Terms of Service (which they never expected the user to read, or understand) to dismiss a user's complaint or to take action against a user. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Are \"Terms of Service\" legally binding that are presented contrary to \"Best Practices\"?"}

This process of historical explanation has been applied to the matter of our profession, especially Of recent years, with great success, and with so much eagerness, and with such a feeling that When you had true historic dogma you had the last word not only in the present but for the immediate future, that I have felt warranted heretofore in throwing out the caution that continuity with the past is only a necessity and not a duty. As soon as a legislature is able to imagine abolishing the requirement of a consideration for a simple contract, it is at perfect liberty to abolish it, if it thinks it wise to do so, without the slightest regard to continuity with the past. The continuity simply limits the possibilities of our imagination, and settles the terms in which we shall be compelled to think.

I understand that you must give them driver's license, proof of insurance, and registration, and I vaguely remember reading in the Arizona's driver's handbook that there are a set of questions you must be prepared to answer in English. However, I am not sure if this is correct. There are generally two theories on being the best way to deal with traffic stops: 1. is to be nice and comply with the officer, nicely answering any questions; 2. is to be nice and comply only to orders they are legally obligated to follow, answering only questions they are legally obligated to answer, and speaking to the officer as minimal as possible. But I would like to test a third theory: speaking a language the officer does not understand, and making it appear that I either barely understand the officer, or barely can speak to the officer in their language (presumably English or Spanish, most likely, in the United States). I am thinking I will start speaking in German to the officer, and hope the officer doesn't speak German. This will frustrate the officer (and make them feel sorry for me), and make the officer want to ask as few questions as possible, without getting frustrated that I refuse to answer them. Thus, reducing the self-incriminating evidence, while reaping the benefits of not being the \"I won't speak to you\" jerk. So if I spoke and listened perfectly in English, would it be obstruction of justice (or otherwise legally a lie) to intentionally construe myself as (or pretend to be) a German speaker, and not an English speaker, to the officer? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Do you have to answer questions in English when pulled over?"}

I was recently very surprised to find out that many males in the United States are circumcised shortly after birth. No one had ever told me (it's not a subject I've spoken at length with anyone about), and certainly no one asked my permission before the procedure was performed on me. And yet it happens all the time, probably still to this day. So this got me thinking, what are the legal limits to which a parent can physically modify a child?

Could they replace all their limbs with state-of-the-art prostheses in an effort to create a Baby Robocop? As far as I know, all of these things can be legally done to oneself, but children aren't old enough to consent, and there are definitely cases where things are done to them against their consent by parents, with the law supporting the parents. Let's assume that any modification has no perceived detriment to the child (for instance, in the limb-chopping scenario, assume prosthesis are advanced enough to match the abilities of natural limbs). Also assume that the procedure is painless, performed by a certified medical professional, and does not impede the mental and physical development of the child.

When talking to Wisconsin state investigators later, Jacob Blake admitted to investigators that he did have a knife in his possession as stated by Attorney General Joshua Kaul: Kaul says Blake had a knife. \"Mr. Blake admitted he had a knife in his possession and DCI agents recovered a knife on the driver's side floorboards of Mr. Blake's vehicle.\" However, the shooting committed by Officer Rusten has caused unrest in the area of Kenosha, Wisconsin, given the concurrent resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement at the time of the shooting. It is the fact of the knife as well as the strong response that has encouraged me to ask the following question: Question Given the presence of the knife in addition to the officers attempting to arrest Jacob Blake for a domestic violence dispute, was that enough justification for the 7 shots (4 of which hit Blake) as a reasonable response by Officer Rusten Sheskey? \nTITLE: ", "output": "Is the presence of a melee weapon such as a knife enough legal justification for a police man to shoot the possessor of the knife?"}

It is understandable why states might be interested in regulating the Visible Light Transmission of the tinting on the front windows -- to make sure the driver could be identified in case of accidents / hit-and-runs / other issues, by both the general public and the police. This is, apparently, why some states, like California, dictate that VLT of the front side windows must not be below 70%, whereas all other windows -- back side and the rear one -- could be as tinted as one pleases, e.g., even limo-style 5% or below is acceptable. However, other states seem to regulate all windows -- front side, back side, and the rear one -- and many mandate at least 35% VLT on all of the windows, whereas some north-east states like New York even go as high as 70% VLT on all windows, which, frankly, doesn't seem reasonable at all. This is especially interesting in light of some vehicles not having any back side windows, nor the rear window. What legitimate interests do the states have in regulating back-side and rear windows? Are those laws enforceable?

Then they existed as an unrecognized state for 14 years before being admitted to the Union as the 14th state, first under their constitution of 1777 and then under their revised constitution of 1786. In 1777 they quickly asked the Continental Congress to be accorded representation in Congress, and being turned down largely because of objections from New York (repeatedly during 1777 through 1785) they took the position that Vermont was not a part of the USA (and in fact engaged in separate peace negotiations with the British, in which they said they would submit to being a British colony if the British would protect them from New York; those negotiations led to some prisoner-of-war exchanges). (Recall that no one ever defined the boundaries of the USA until the preliminary articles of peace were signed in November 1782, and they included Vermont within the boundaries. They had to do that because New York claimed Vermont was a part of New York.) When Vermont was admitted to the Union in March 1791 (after the legislature of New York decided in 1790 to give up that state's claims on condition that Congress decided to admit Vermont) no new state constitution took effect and no new governor assumed office, nor new justices of the state's highest court, etc. The state government simply continued. Governor Thomas Chittenden, sworn in in October 1790, continued his term of office. (Chittenden was actually re-elected annually from 1778 to 1788, but then Moses Robinson served a one-year term as governor from October 1789 to October 1790, then Chittenden was again re-elected repeatedly until he died in 1797.) The act of Congress admitting Vermont to the Union did not say anything about creation of a new state or a new state government, but rather said \"The State of Vermont\" had \"petitioned the Congress\" for admission. So it appears that under Vermont law, no new state was created but an already existing state got admitted to the Union, and federal law said nothing to the contrary. (Congress passed several bills pertaining to Vermont in February and March 1791. One of them admitted the state to the Union; one created a federal court in Vermont; one established a port of entry and customs house or something like that, where people entered the state from Canada; one fixed the number of representatives Vermont would have in Congress; and one provided that the U.S. census, conducted elsewhere during the previous year, should be extended into Vermont.) So does the full-faith-and-credit clause of the U.S. Constitution require every state to grant full faith and credit to to official acts of the State of Vermont during its years as an unrecognized state? Is there a sort of tacit retroactive recognition? (Vermont's constitution got revised again in 1793, and I suspect one reason for that was that it was no longer appropriate to have a list of grievances against New York in the state constitution.) \nTITLE: ", "output": "Full faith and credit to Vermont"}

The lawyer drafted a contract with Asset Y (a totally different Asset) as indemnity. Further, he attached several Exhibits to the contract that don't clearly relate to either Asset X or Y, and only confuse the picture. Company A failed to perform, but won't hand over Asset X, and my friend doesn't have the indemnity that he envisioned because of the way the contract was drafted. (A first year law student could probably have done better.) That's the causation. The harm comes from the fact that my friend now has to sue Company A, which might not be necessary if the contract was solid. The breach of duty comes from the disregard of instructions to \"securitize\" Asset X. Does this constitute legal malpractice, and if so, what are the remedies?

My contract of employment with this primary employer states the following: During your employment you will: devote the whole of your time, attention and ability to carrying out your duties with due care and attention; not, without the prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly be engaged, concerned or interested in any other business whatsoever, provided that you are not prohibited from holding or being beneficially interested in, by way of investment, any shares or securities of any company quoted on any recognised investment exchange (including an overseas investment exchange) as defined in section 285 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and comprising not more than 1% of any single class of such shares or securities. I intend to take up paid additional employment i.e. a 2nd job, for 20% of my time (7.5-8 hrs/week) for another UK-based employer (salary prorated to 20% & paid to my UK bank account). This 2nd employer is a non-profit (higher education) entity, and does not compete in the business interests/segments of my primary full-time employer. At the time of interviewing for this 20% role, I was not in my current primary employment, and therefore did not have the obligation to inform them about it. The reason for taking up the 2nd job is just to try out if I transition to a full-time role eventually with them (after 2 months of trying out the new role/commute etc.) I have the following questions: To obtain consent for from my primary employer for this additional 20% employment, do I have to show the contract of employment with my 2nd employer to my current primary employer (or does it suffice to inform my current employer via just an email?) What are my disclosure obligations to the 2nd (part-time) employer? Will I have to tell them that I am already working full-time with the 1st employer? What kind of documents will I have to submit to the proposed part-time employer (i.e. current employment contract, payslips etc?). I'd like to keep the identity of my primary employer confidential. At the time of interviewing for this 20% role, I was not in my current primary employment, and therefore did not have the obligation to inform them about it. Is it still legally possible to not inform my 2nd (20%) employer about my current full-time employment. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Disclosure obligations to employers: UK full-time salaried employee intending to take up additional paid employment 20% with a non-competing business"}

This is in the context of a commercial operator (like a white water rafting company) getting a commercial permit to take clients down a river in National Park lands. The commercial operator is required to carry insurance, and nearly all insurance companies require clients to sign documents that waive their rights to hold the commercial operator responsible for actions (as much as can be enforced). The National Parks say this: NPS policy states that operators cannot require visitors (clients) to waive their right to hold Commercial Use Authorization (CUA) or Special Use Permit (SUP) holders responsible for actions. The Holder is not permitted to require clients to sign a waiver of liability statement or form, insurance disclaimer and/or indemnification agreement. ... Let's imagine that in the past a commercial operator has had clients sign those releases, while holding a National Park commercial permit. 1) Is the release signed by the client independent of whatever the National Park's policy (above) states? 2) Are those releases subject to challenge because they violated an aspect of the permit? 3) Is the only real material affect going to be potential discipline from the NPS for violating the terms of the commercial permit, by clients signing liability waivers. Additionally: Apparently the history for this is because of a law that doesn't allow the federal government, in this case the NPS, to be released of liability. \nTITLE: ", "output": "Restrictions on Liability Waiver Use"}

I opted to \"sell by owner\" using the popular site forsalebyowner.com. I opted for a package that includes an MLS number and posting to popular real estate sites. After pulling the trigger, I find that apparently Idaho state law does not allow the sale of any property without a broker taking on the owner as a \"customer\". I learned this from a broker who called me. He was sent by forsalebyowner.com and is responsible for creating the MLS number. He quoted Idaho code 54-2086. The part that stands out: (3) The duties set forth in this section are mandatory and may not be waived or abrogated, either unilaterally or by agreement. My impression until today was that neither a broker nor an agent was required for any real estate sale. The two parties could open escrow and proceed without them, though it is often advised to have a \"real estate attorney\" draft and review all documents before you sign them. Indeed, after reading nearly everything on forsalebyowner.com, this impression was reinforced. To the broker's credit, he conceded that Idaho is a bit unique.

As part of the acquisition deal, they offered us substantial 3-year retention bonuses on top of signing bonuses, etc. The stipulations of the retention bonus were fairly standard: If I quit before the designated date, I get none of the bonus If they fire me with no cause before the end date, I get a prorated portion of the bonus from the time we were acquired. If I am fired with cause, I get nothing As of last September (2016), the company started delaying our paychecks by a few days, then weeks, then up to a month. Some of us are 6 paychecks behind. It has put many of us in financial hardship. We live in Oregon, and have given them a \"notice of underpayment\" (ORS 652.120), which they did not comply with. At this point, many of us are preparing to quit and move on. I plan on filing a complaint with OBLI soon because of their non-compliance.
