[NeMo W 2024-08-22 22:14:49 nemo_logging:349] /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pytorch_lightning/trainer/configuration_validator.py:161: You have overridden `MegatronGPTSFTModel.configure_sharded_model` which is deprecated. Please override the `configure_model` hook instead. Instantiation with the newer hook will be created on the device right away and have the right data type depending on the precision setting in the Trainer.

If you consume the iterator more than once per step, the `batch_idx` argument in any hook that takes it will not match with the batch index of the last batch consumed. This might have unforeseen effects on callbacks or code that expects to get the correct index. This will also not work well with gradient accumulation. This feature is very experimental and subject to change. Here be dragons.
